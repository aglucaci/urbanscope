    "description": "Wastewater-based surveillance has emerged as a powerful tool for monitoring microbial diversity, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). In this study, wastewater samples collected from March 2022 to March 2024 from 19 locations in four metropolitan cities of India were profiled using shotgun metagenomics. Taxonomic abundance and beta diversity analyses revealed significant differences in microbial community compositions, with city-specific clustering; suggesting distinct local environmental influences. However, such distinct clusters were not evident with the ARGs. A high proportion of potentially novel metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) (53-70%) were identified on reconstructing the microbial genomes from the metagenomic data. ARGs conferring resistance to antibiotics such as tetracyclines and beta-lactams showed higher association with MGEs in contrast to macrolide resistance genes. Microbial co-occurrence network analysis revealed a city-specific structure and higher contribution of ARGs from specific communities of microbes. These findings underscore the complex interplay between microbial diversity, ARG dissemination, and MGEs in wastewater environments, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance, for designing appropriate mitigation strategies towards curbing the spread of antimicrobial resistance.",

In this study, surface water samples were collected in two different sites: the artificial lake Bidighinzu (drinking water supply) and the coastal lagoon Cabras (fisheries), both located in the Mediterranean area. Samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun sequencings and their bacterial communities, pathobiomes, and antimicrobial resistomes were characterized.

    "description": "The biological state of clinically non-lesional skin in acne remains incompletely characterized, despite its potential relevance to disease progression and early intervention. Using longitudinal multi-omics profiling, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V1–V3 and V4), shotgun metagenomics, and UPLC-MS/MS metabolomics, of facial skin from 10 individuals with acne (lesional and non-lesional sites) and 10 healthy controls across multiple time points, we identified microbial and metabolic differences across healthy, non-lesional, and lesional skin. Compositional tensor factorization showed that non-lesional acne skin occupied an intermediate position between healthy and lesional skin in both microbiome and metabolome profiles. Acne-associated skin displayed reduced microbial diversity with strain-level and temporal changes correlating with lesion severity. Machine learning classification distinguished healthy from acne lesional samples (AUC=0.67) and healthy from acne non-lesional samples (AUC=0.70). Metabolomics revealed widespread lipid alterations, including elevated N-oleoylethanolamine (a PPAR-α agonist related to sebum production) consistently present in both non-lesional and lesional acne skin. Amino acid perturbations, particularly of (iso)leucine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine, were pronounced even in non-lesional sites. Integrative microbe–metabolite association analyses revealed distinct co-occurrence patterns in acne, while healthy skin showed enrichment of protective metabolites including urocanic acid. These findings indicate that clinically normal-appearing skin in individuals with acne exhibits measurable microbial and metabolic differences compared to healthy skin, providing a foundation for future studies evaluating candidate biomarkers and microbiome-informed intervention strategies.",

This study comparatively evaluated micro electric fields (MEF) and pulsed electric fields (PEF) for enhancing a microalgae-bacteria system (MBS) treating real municipal wastewater at 5 - 15 degrees Celsius. Both electric field modes significantly improved biomass accumulation, photosynthetic pigment synthesis, Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production, and nutrient and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal compared with non-electrified controls. PEF provided stronger short-term stimulation of biomass growth and pollutant removal, particularly at 10 - 15 degrees Celsius, whereas MEF showed more stable enhancement at 5 degrees Celsius. Phosphorus removal exhibited a pronounced electrochemical-biological synergy, electrocoagulation created favorable flocculation conditions, while biological assimilation and EPS-mediated aggregation contributed over 60% of total TP removal across all temperatures. Energy analysis further showed that PEF reduced volumetric energy consumption by 20 - 50% relative to MEF at equivalent voltages. Overall, electro-assisted microalgal-bacterial treatment offers an energy-efficient strategy for wastewater management under low temperature conditions.",

To comply with NASA Planetary Protection (PP) standards, spacecraft surfaces are currently evaluated using the NASA Standard Assay (NSA) - a cultivation-based method that detects only heat-shock-resistant, aerobic, heterotrophic, spore-forming bacteria. The overarching goal of this study is to establish and validate a next-generation molecular framework for quantifying (qPCR) and characterizing microbial burden (shotgun metagenome sequencing) on spacecraft-associated environmental surfaces. We employ an integrated approach combining optimized sample collection, metagenomic sequencing, and dPCR-based enumeration to enable high-resolution, contamination-resilient microbial surveillance in support of NASA's evolving PP needs. This study addresses a critical knowledge and capability gap by directly comparing molecular tools for determining cleanliness of spacecraft associated surfaces and evaluating their sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility across a range of surface types and bioburden levels.",

    "description": "Emerging evidence highlights the gut-brain axis as a key pathway linking diet and anxiety, but the specific dietary and gut microbiome drivers remain unclear. In this study, we investigated associations between dietary intake, gut microbiome composition, and anxiety in a subclinical cohort of 46 females (18–24 years) from the United Kingdom.  Long-term diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2020) derived from a food frequency questionnaire, stratifying participants into lower and higher diet quality clusters. Short-term dietary intake was assessed via 24-hour recalls. Shotgun metagenomics of stool samples was used to assees differences in α and β diversity indices, species abundances, and bacterial pathways putatively metabolizing gut-brain-axis relevant molecules. Anxiety was measured using the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale – STAI-s).  Regression models identified diet quality (HEI cluster) as the primary dietary feature of anxiety variation. The presence of Ruminococcus B gnavus and Flavonifractor plautii, and the abundances of several species were positively associated with STAI-s, with Bilophila wadsworthia explaining 40% of its variance. The presence of Feacalibacterium prausnitzii and greater abundances of butyrate, propionate, and GABA synthesis pathways were inversely associated with anxiety. Non-linear models revealed a U-shaped relationship between inositol synthesis and STAI-s. Finally, we found that habitual diet quality may modulate anxiety-related responses to short-term dietary variation.  These findings reveal widespread links between long-term diet quality, microbiota composition and function, and anxiety symptoms. These results point towards several promising targets for prebiotic, probiotic, postbiotic, and dietary interventions targets aimed at reducing anxiety.",

    "description": "Exogenous CO2 injection has shown inconsistent effects on anaerobic digestion performance due to variations in substrate properties and operational parameters. This study investigated the effects of CO2 injection on microbial community composition, key metabolic pathways, and methane yield. CO2 influenced bacterial populations, promoting the enrichment of hydrolytic acidogenic microbes that accelerate the breakdown of complex organics and generate precursors for methanogenesis, while methanogenic archaea remained stable, maintaining both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways. Functional gene analysis showed enhanced abundances in the Acetyl CoA and Wood Ljungdahl pathways, indicating improved carbon flux toward methane precursors, whereas excessive CO2 could potentially limit Coenzyme M availability by overproducing Acetyl-CoA, highlighting the need for controlled dosing. Operational optimization identified a food waste-to-sludge ratio of 3:1 and an organic load of 5 g VS L-1 d-1 as optimal, yielding 0.159 L CH4/g VS, outperforming other tested ratios. These results demonstrate that CO2 injection can effectively improve substrate conversion efficiency and methane production while maintaining microbial stability. The findings provide practical guidance for high-load anaerobic digestion management and illustrate the potential of CO2 modulation to enhance system performance.",

    "description": "Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics and/or prebiotics, compared to placebo, for preventing infections in preterm and/or LBW infant. Some of the most compelling evidence comes from a recent randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted by Panigrahi and colleagues, where newborns (≥ 35 weeks ‘gestation and ≥ 2,000 grams) residing in rural India were randomized to receive Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) ATCC 202195 plus fructooligosaccharide (FOS), or placebo, once daily for seven consecutive days, starting on day two to four of life. Relative to the placebo group, infants in the synbiotic group had a 40% lower risk of the combined primary outcome of sepsis and all-cause mortality, and a 78% lower risk of culture-confirmed sepsis. As a result of the promising safety profile and strong mechanistic rationale regarding its plausible probiotic effects, L. plantarum has garnered interest as a potential intervention for preventing sepsis and pSBI in infants. Although the Panigrahi et al. study provides strong evidence for the proposed beneficial effects,the effects of L. plantarum administration on the infant microbiome has not been fully described. Most of what we know about the microbiome comes from high-income settings. This is because, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are currently underrepresented in global microbiome study. In addition, recent work highlights the influence of geography on the composition and stability of the gut microbiota. This study will examine the effects of neonatal oral administration of Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) ATCC 202195 (109 CFU/day) with fructooligosaccharide (FOS), versus placebo, on the community structure, diversity and metabolite production of the microbiota of infants in Dhaka, Bangladesh",

    "description": "Environmental surveillance has emerged as a pivotal strategy for early detection of pathogens that pose threats to humans but has not been utilized for zoonotic agents. In Asia, live-bird markets (LBMs) are key human-animal interfaces for zoonotic virus transmission. Traditional sampling strategies are time-consuming, expensive, threaten animal welfare and have significant occupational biosafety risks. In this study, we assessed the performance of metagenomics on environmental samples (ES)  compared to traditional poultry swabs for detecting avian viral pathogens in LBMs in Cambodia. ES, including air, cage swabs, and carcass wash water, were collected alongside throat and cloacal swabs from domestic chickens and ducks across twelve sampling visits in two LBMs over a 15-month period. Viral nucleic acids were extracted and sequenced using a capture probe-based metagenomics approach. Our results show that metagenomics on ES outperformed traditional poultry samples in detecting the highly pathogenic Influenza A/H5N1, including circulating clades 2.3.4.4b and 2.3.2.1c, which were found in the environment but missed by poultry swabs on multiple occasions. Environmental metagenomics was also highly sensitive in the detection of over 40 other viruses from key pathogen families such as Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Retroviridae. Viral contigs from ES showed high similarity to those from poultry swabs further highlighting the accuracy of this approach. Our findings highlight metagenomics on ES can precisely and effectively replicate metagenomic results from traditional surveillance samples, offering broader coverage and enhanced detection of avian pathogens. This robust approach could be pivotal for mitigating zoonotic spillover, controlling pathogen transmission at LBMs, and enhancing pandemic preparedness strategies.",

Additionally, Mn@BC supplementation enhanced extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secretion and enriched the microbial community structure.Furthermore, the rapidly growing microalgae absorbed substantial amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus through photosynthesis, achieving synchronous N&amp;P removal, with the phosphorus removal efficiency maintained at 51%. TOC analysis confirmed that photosynthesis generated dissolved organic carbon (DOC), thereby reducing the system's reliance on external organic carbon sources.Metagenomic sequencing was employed to investigate the functional microorganisms and potential metabolic pathways. By integrating reactor performance, sludge characteristics, and microbial community structure, the microbial interactions were elucidated, thereby proposing a potential mechanism of the Mn@BC-enhanced SAAD system under low-temperature conditions.",

    "description": "Biological denitrification is limited by slow nitrate (NO3-) reduction due to low electron transfer efficiency, unsatisfactory community functional efficiency and insufficient metabolic activity of microbial communities. To overcome these challenges, Ni2+ and Fe2+ were incorporated with gallic acid (GA) to form bimetallic polyphenol networks (NiFeGA BPNs) with low-cost and high-biocompatibility. NiFeGA BPNs exhibited capacitive Ni(II)/Fe(II) redox cycles and excellent ligand-to-metal charge transfer capabilities to enable complete degradation of 200 mg/L NO3- within 8 h. All these improvements could be ascribed to that NiFeGA BPNs significantly improved electron transfer efficiency and stimulated microbial metabolic activity, which were proved by extracellular polymeric substances electrochemical analysis and electron transport chain inhibitors experiments. More importantly, metagenomic sequencing analysis confirmed that NiFeGA BPNs improved community structure by directionally enriching Pseudomonas. Consequently, NiFeGA BPNs significantly improving denitrification, which provides both theoretical guidance and technical frameworks for the continuous and efficient treatment of nitrate in wastewater.",

This research demonstrated that pyrrhotite with iron vacancies and lower Fe–S bond energy (1.35 eV) facilitated efficient electron transfer and microbial utilization of reduced sulfur to achieve nitrate autotrophic denitrification to dinitrogen. Conversely, FeS2, possessing strong Fe–S bonding (1.63 eV), showed minimal reactivity due to restricted electron mobility. FeS, with intermediate bond energy (1.39 eV) and abundant sulfur vacancies, supported simultaneous abiotic nitrate–to–ammonium conversion and microbial denitrification. These mineral−specific mechanisms support nitrogen transformations in diverse anoxic systems, from wetland to marine sediments, ultimately determining the global nitrogen cycling. Furthermore, tuning iron sulfide phases and vacancy structures presents novel strategies for sustainable, wastewater treatment, steering nitrate removal toward nutrient recovery or benign gas production.",

    "description": "Integrating anammox with fermentation is expected to achieve efficient nitrogen removal and in-situ reduction of excess sludge, which can significantly reduce the cost of mainstream wastewater treatment. In this research, the feasibility of rapid start-up of simultaneous partial nitrification, anammox, denitrification and fermentation (SNADF) process by fermented sludge bioaugmentation was studied. In addition, excess sludge was regularly supplied to the system to explore the sludge treatment potential of the SNADF system. Within 81 days, the SNADF system achieved efficient nitrogen removal (88.17%), coupled with significant sludge reduction capability (Yobs: -0.394 kgMLSS/kgCOD). An in-situ test revealed the synergistic relationship between fermentation and partial denitrification/anammox (PD/A) in the absence of organics, indicating the start-up of SNADF system. Moreover, the continuous decrease in biomass concentration indicated the considerable potential of SNADF in treating the excess sludge. The anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB) were obviously enriched (0.03%-0.25%), ensuring efficient nitrogen removal. The ammonia oxidizing bacteria in excess sludge facilitated AnAOB enrichment, while the excess sludge increased biomass concentration and promoted fermentation. The fermentation process mainly stopped at the acid-producing stage and promoted PD/A process. These results suggest that the SNADF system simultaneously promoted fermentation and nitrogen removal in a single reactor.",

    "description": "The spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in wildlife represents a significant concern due to its potential impact on public health and ecosystem functioning. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and diversity of ARGs in the fecal microbiota of coatis (Nasua nasua) inhabiting an urban ecological park in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Fecal samples from individuals of different age and sex classes - including adult, subadult, and infant males and females - were analyzed for genes belonging to the tet, lnu, qnr, cmy, dfr, sul, erm, and ant families, which confer resistance to multiple antimicrobial classes. Results revealed that adult males harbored the highest diversity of ARGs, a pattern consistent with their social and dispersal behavior, which exposes them to a wider range of environmental microbial sources. These findings highlight the potential role of wildlife social structure and movement patterns in shaping the acquisition and dissemination of ARGs, emphasizing the importance of monitoring urban wildlife as part of strategies to understand and mitigate antimicrobial resistance.",

    "description": "Wetlands are critical ecosystems where anthropogenic pressures can create public health risks. Adopting a One Health framework, we developed and deployed an integrated surveillance strategy across twelve European wetlands with varying human impact. Our approach combines non-invasive passive water sampling with a multi-omic nanopore sequencing workflow to concurrently profile vertebrate communities (12S eDNA), the water microbiome, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. The framework successfully identified sites under heavy anthropogenic influence, particularly animal farming, as locations with high relative abundances of potential pathogens and AMR genes. We established a strong source-pathogen association at a French duck farm, where a dominant eDNA signal from farmed ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) coincided with high relative abundances of the pathogen Aeromonas veronii. Crucially, leveraging long-read data for metagenomic assembly allowed us to confirm this association with high confidence by locating multiple β-lactamase genes directly on assembled A. veronii contigs. In addition to these contemporary threats, our approach also uncovered a legacy of historical pollution, identifying arsenic resistance genes (arsB, arsC) on contigs from Acidiphilium multivorum, a bacterium indicative of metal-contaminated sites. By genetically linking specific AMR determinants to potential pathogens and their likely agricultural sources, this work demonstrates a powerful framework for prioritizing sites for targeted environmental monitoring. This integrated approach moves beyond simple hazard detection to provide valuable genomic context essential for hazard identification and mitigation strategies under a One Health paradigm.",

    "title": "Airborne ARGs in Nordic Urban Homes",
    "description": "Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in airborne dust represent an emerging concern for public health, particularly in indoor environments where external environmental pressures may shape their abundance and diversity. This study assessed the temporal and spatial patterns of airborne ARGs in indoor dust across four Nordic cities (Aarhus, Bergen, Reykjavik, and Uppsala) using electrostatic dust collectors (EDCs) at two time points: 2012 and 2022. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to profile ARGs, while national antibiotic consumption data were obtained from the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC-Net). Outdoor air pollution data (PM2.5 and PM10) were retrieved from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and meteorological parameters were obtained from the NASA POWER database. Beta diversity analysis revealed significant city-specific differences in ARG composition (PERMANOVA, R² = 0.18, p = 0.03), but no consistent temporal shift over the 10-year period. Macrolide, Tetracycline, and Aminoglycoside resistance genes were among the most abundant and persistent classes. Notably, a new resistance gene (Macrolide_85) emerged across all cities in 2022. While overall antibiotic consumption declined, its correlation with ARG abundance increased over time (Spearman’s R = 0.37 in 2022 vs. 0.25 in 2012), suggesting the persistence of ARGs despite reduced selective pressure. Several ARG classes were significantly associated with outdoor particulate matter concentrations, and these associations were further modulated by meteorological conditions. For instance, absolute humidity reduced the PM–Polymyxin resistance association, while wind speed enhanced the association between PM and sulfonamide resistance. These findings highlight the complex and context-specific interplay between antibiotic use, air pollution, meteorological parameters, and ARG dynamics in indoor air. Integrating environmental surveillance with antimicrobial resistance monitoring is crucial for assessing ARG transmission risks in built environments, particularly in the context of climate change.",

    "title": "Application of antibiotics for the selective isolation of previously uncultured bacteria from activated sludge",
    "description": "Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in urban areas, ensuring the protection of both human health and the environment. Among the various technologies used for wastewater treatment, activated sludge (AS) is by far the most widespread. AS contains a complex microbial community responsible for degrading organic materials, facilitating resource recovery, and returning treated water to the environment. Understanding the composition of these microbial communities is crucial for optimizing WWTP processes. While DNA-based studies have identified which bacterial taxa are commonly found in the activated sludge and provided clues into their specific roles, culture-based methods are necessary to validate these observations. However, isolating environmental bacteria remains challenging due to the difficulty in replicating their specific growth conditions in the laboratory and competition from fast-growing bacteria. In this project, dispersed bacteria from AS were cultured in media containing ultrafiltered, sterilized AS fluid, supplemented with one of eleven antibiotics to modify microbial structure.The results showed that this method reduced microbial diversity and altered microbial composition in an antibiotic-specific manner. Although this method did not facilitate the isolation of previously uncultured genera, we successfully isolated 26 species of which 8 were novel. Five of these represent taxa previously found in AS, demonstrating that the isolation strategy can be used to obtain ecosystem-relevant species. Further attempts could be focused on tailoring growth conditions for targeting bacteria of interest after modifying the microbial profile.",

To study the role of bile acid receptor FXR in IHC-induced atherosclerosis, we exposed ApoE-/- x FXR-/- and ApoE-/- mice to IHC or Air for 10 weeks, fed with high fat diet (HFD). Atherosclerotic lesion data revealed that IHC-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice was not observed in ApoE-/- FXR-/- mice, suggesting that FXR plays an important role in IHC-induced atherosclerosis. Examination of microbiome and metabolome profiles in these mice will help us better understand the underlying mechanisms.",

    "description": "Human-associated microbes are a key determinant of human health, development and disease. For instance, microbial communities in the human gut play a vital role in host metabolism and in the stimulation and development of the host innate immune system. Perturbations to these microbial assemblies, referred to as dysbiosis, are linked to negative health outcomes including allergies, obesity, undernutrition and early childhood sepsis. Most of what we know about the microbiome comes from high-income settings. This is because, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are currently underrepresented in global microbiome study. In addition, recent work highlights the influence of geography on the composition and stability of the gut microbiota. For example, Prevotella, prevalent in LMICs, is virtually absent in high-income countries. Even within LMICs, the relative abundance of Prevotella varies substantially. For instance, among Bangladeshi children the presence of Prevotella is far below that in children from Mali, Kenya and The Gambia. This study will describe the composition, diversity, stability, and metabolic activity of gut and body microorganisms in Bangladeshi mother-infant pairs and examine how each of these characteristics vary temporally and by body habitat, mode of delivery, exposure to antibiotics and maternal, infant and household characteristics. In addition, it will examine the human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) profile of breast milk collected from lactating women in Bangladesh and examine how HMO profile varies temporally, and by secretor status, maternal age, parity, diet, mode of delivery, season of milk collection, infant feeding pattern, and other maternal, infant and household characteristics. This will help us understand the relationship between mother and infant gut and body microbial communities over time and in the early postnatal period, gut microbiomes and microbial derived metabolites in mother-infant pairs and finally, HMO profiles and the composition of the infant gut microbiome.",

    "description": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major health concern, and a range of antibiotic concentrations and non-antibiotic agents can select for AMR. Selection for AMR is often investigated using single compounds, however, in the natural environment and the human body, pharmaceuticals will be present as mixtures, including both non-antibiotic drugs (NADs), and antibiotics. Here, we assessed the effects of one of three NADs in combination with ciprofloxacin, a commonly used antibiotic that is often found at concentrations in global freshwaters sufficiently high to select for AMR. We used a combination of growth assays and qPCR to determine selective concentrations of mixtures and used metagenome sequencing to identify changes to the resistome and community composition. The selective concentration of ciprofloxacin was reduced in mixtures, and some changes in selection for specific genes or species were observed. Results show that NADs and ciprofloxacin are more selective than ciprofloxacin alone and these mixtures can cause distinct changes to the community composition. This indicates that future work should on the maintenance and spread of AMR should consider combinations of antibiotics and NADs.",

    "description": "This study innovatively demonstrates the feasibility of coupling PD with anammox (PD/A) using nitrifying sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as the sole inoculum, achieving simultaneous anammox bacteria enrichment and ultra-high-rate nitrogen removal. Rapid establishment of stable PD within 40 days, achieving an 84.6 % nitrate-to-nitrite transformation ratio (NTR). Anammox bacteria enrichment without external anammox inoculum, culminating in a nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 1.11 kg N/(m3 d) and 95.0 % total nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) after 190 days, the nitrogen removal performance surpassing most conventional systems. Metabolomic profiling revealed significant upregulation in three core metabolic networks: Enhanced heme synthesis can promote cytochrome c production for electron transport chain optimization in anammox reactions. Upregulation of aspartate metabolism facilitated carbon skeleton supply for anammox bacteria (AnAOB) growth and energy supply, upregulation of nucleotide metabolism boosted transcriptional activity of AnAOB and denitrifying bacteria (DNB). These mechanistic insights elucidate the metabolic synergy driving PD/A systems, advancing their scalability for energy-efficient mainstream wastewater treatment applications.",

    "description": "OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the mechanistic role of gut microbial bile acid modifications on the metabolic and reproductive features of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared two PCOS-like mouse models using (1) 5 week daily oral gavage of letrozole (LET), and (2) 90 day subcutaneous release of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). We introduced a stably colonized engineered native bacteria (ENB) that overexpresses bile salt hydrolase (BSH) using a single oral gavage, thus facilitating bile acid deconjugation in the gut and changing the luminal bile acid pool, verified by targeted metabolomics. We analyzed the estrous cycle through vaginal cytology, and collected serum and reproductive tissues to measure hormone levels and evaluate ovarian histology. We assessed metabolic phenotype through an insulin tolerance test, EchoMRI body compositional analysis, and fasted and fed levels of insulin, glucose, and incretins. Stool was collected for 16S and untargeted metabolomics, and liver for RNA-seq. RESULTS: Both DHT and LET mouse models mimic the metabolic and reproductive features of PCOS, including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, anovulation, cystic follicles, and hyperandrogenism. Increased adiposity was observed in the DHT model but not in the LET model, presenting both lean and obese models of PCOS. Introduction of BSH-expressing ENB restored insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels in the LET mice without significant change in adiposity. BSH-treated LET mice also had decreased ovary weights and a decrease in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels with no change in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. Stool metabolomics and 16S analyses are ongoing to characterize differences between conditions in each model at the level of the gut. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that microbiome modulation of bile acids plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Comparison of lean and obese models of PCOS provide clues about the role of adiposity in altered insulin signaling and other manifestations of the syndrome. Additionally, differential modulation of LH and FSH implicate non-hypothalamic modulation by bile acid signaling, perhaps at the site of the ovaries or liver. IMPACT STATEMENT: Despite affecting 10-15% of reproductive age women, PCOS is not well understood and often ineffectively treated. Common interventions like weight loss can be unattainable, or an infeasible solution, particularly for those with insulin resistance independent of obesity. This study illustrates the potential of the gut microbiome as a diagnostic tool and/or therapeutic target for PCOS, and reveals novel crosstalk between the microbiome, gut, and HPG axis.",

An estimated 60% of known infectious diseases and up to 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin. Despite this, relatively little is known about the alterations to the human microbiome in persons with a high degree of close contact with animals on farms.

    "description": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is on one of the global priority challenges because clinicians are running out of effective antimicrobials to treat infections. This context has nurtured our idea to explore the impact of diet alteration on abundance and diversity of AMR bacteria using metagenomic analysis at large population level.  The study was conducted during the annual vegetarian festival in Thailand in October 2019, when there was a shift from regular to a vegetarian diet at a population level for 10 consecutive days. We used urban sewage to monitor abundance and diversity of AMR before (a month, 15 days and 3 days before), during (daily for 10 days) and after the festival (3 days, 15 days and a month after) in three cities in Thailand. Inlet sewage samples were collected from a city in the north (Nakhon Sawan), the south (Surat Thani), and the capital city, Bangkok. Faecal samples from individuals in the northern city were also collected. All samples were analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metagenomic mapping was performed against bacteria, ResFinder (AMR genes) and Cazy (carbohydrate-active enzymes) databases. We found significant changes of AMR gene abundance as well as an increase of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism in the sewage samples from all three cities in Thailand during the vegetarian festival. In addition, the composition and diversity of bacterial species in the sewage samples significantly changed during the vegetarian festival; especially in the northern city. Total abundance of AMR genes was higher during the vegetarian festival in all the three cities. This study exhibited the correlation between population’s vegetarian diet and an increase of AMR in Thailand and metagenomic analysis in sewage can be used for determining an impact of dietary modulation in population level on bacterial community and AMR.",

    "description": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and air pollution have been identified as one of the most serious threats to human health worldwide. The scarce data demonstrating their interdependence indicates a need to obtain evidence from a broader global area, especially from regions exposed to high air pollution. Considering that Serbia is a country struggling with excessive antibiotics use and misuse, a high percentage of multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates, and poor air quality, the Serbian capital Belgrade has been recognized as an interesting research model for the effects of air pollution on the airborne transmission of AMR. After optimization of air sampling and DNA extraction protocol, the air samples will be collected at nine locations in the Belgrade metropolitan area selected according to air pollution level during four seasons. The state-of-the-art shotgun metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of obtained sequences will provide information about microbial community composition of airborne metagenomes. In addition, sequenced airborne metagenomes will be analyzed for the abundance and diversity of resistomes (antibiotic and biocide/metal resistance genes) and mobilomes using several databases and tools. Correlation analyses will offer us insight into the effect of air pollution and seasonal variations on abundance and diversity of airborne pathogens, resistome and mobilome in the Belgrade metropolitan area. In-depth approach of the AirPollRes project will provide the first insights into intersection of AMR and air pollution in the Belgrade metropolitan area, which is highly vulnerable to these health threats. As the AirPollRes is a pioneering project in this field, the expected short-term impact is the introduction of routine monitoring of pathogenic microbes and resistance determinants in the air in Belgrade, while the longer-term impact will be reflected in the improvement of human and animal health, allowing for a longer life with higher quality.",

    "description": "The application of untreated livestock manure poses significant risks for disseminating antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in agricultural ecosystems, yet the mechanisms underlying risk mitigation through manure pretreatment remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically evaluated the synergistic effects of gamma irradiation and hydrogen peroxide on ARG dynamics in chicken manure and it amended soils. Integrated metagenomic analysis and soil microcosm experiments revealed that the combined treatment achieved the greatest reductions in both the abundance and diversity of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), outperforming individual treatments. Specifically, in the fertilizer, the ARGs and MGEs in the combined treatment were reduced by 29.47% and 24.25%, respectively, compared to control. The intervention selectively depleted ARG-harboring taxa, including Cellvibrio, Alicyclobacillus, and Chitinophaga, while concurrently suppressing microbial functions critical to ARG dissemination-particularly biofilm formation, membrane transport (ABC transporter genes), and SOS response pathways. Soil application of pretreated manure maintained ARG suppression via reconstructuring of functional pathways, with structural equation modeling identifying microbial community shifts as the primary driver. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for physical-chemical manure pretreatment, highlighting gamma irradiation/hydrogen peroxide co-treatment as an effective strategy to disrupt manure-to-soil ARG transmission while preserving agricultural value.",

    "description": "Accurate and reproducible gut microbiome profiling depends heavily on the DNA extraction method, particularly in low-biomass samples such as neonatal stool. In this study, we evaluated the performance of three commercially available DNA extraction kits - QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini, DNeasy PowerSoil Pro, and ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep on neonatal stool samples collected in a resource-limited hospital in Kano, Nigeria. Samples were stored under various conditions (temperature and preservatives), and DNA was extracted and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore long-read technology. Our results showed that fresh, unpreserved samples yielded significantly higher DNA concentrations than stored or preserved samples. Kits incorporating mechanical lysis (PowerSoil and ZymoBIOMICS) outperformed the chemical lysis-based QIAamp kit in DNA yield and microbial recovery. While microbial diversity and taxonomic profiles were comparable between PowerSoil and ZymoBIOMICS, PowerSoil produced longer sequencing reads and required less processing time, making it more suitable for long-read metagenomics in field conditions. We conclude that same-day processing using bead-beating-based extraction kits improves yield and reduces bias in neonatal gut microbiome studies. These findings are especially relevant for low-resource settings, where equipment limitations and delayed sample processing can impact data quality and study scalability.",

Unlike previous systems, this approach facilitated effective cooperation between Candidatus Accumulibacter, Dechloromonas, and sidestream fermentation microorganisms, eliminating the need for Tetrasphaera in phosphorus removal. In the two-stage operation, removal efficiencies for COD and PO4 3- P increased from seventy-three point seven percent and seventy-five point three percent to eighty-three point two percent and ninety-one point eight percent, respectively. The system exhibited significant biological activity, with peak phosphorus release reaching forty-nine point three milligrams per liter in a typical cycle, marking a sixty-six percent improvement compared to Phase I. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed successful enrichment of functional microorganisms, with Candidatus Accumulibacter and Dechloromonas reaching twelve point nine percent and six point two percent in the mainstream reactor, respectively. Additionally, key genes (ugpQ, ppk1, phnC) and enzymes (polyphosphate kinase, adenylate kinase) associated with phosphorus removal were enriched. Overall, the novel S2EBPR system demonstrated stable operation, with Candidatus Accumulibacter and Dechloromonas as the primary enriched phosphorus-accumulating organisms, successfully collaborating with fermentative microbes.",

    "description": "This project investigates oxidative stress as a novel mechanism to enhance microbial biocatalysis of emerging organic micropollutants (OMPs), including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and personal care products in wastewater. Aerobic microbial respiration generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate antioxidant responses involving oxidoreductases such as peroxidases and cytochrome P450s—enzymes capable of transforming a wide range of OMPs. We explored how environmental triggers, including dynamic dissolved oxygen (DO) perturbations and exogenous ROS exposure, modulate these enzymatic pathways in farm and municipal sludge microbiomes.  A key focus was the role of the neuroactive hormone L-norepinephrine (L-NE) in inducing oxidative stress and influencing microbial growth and metabolism. Exposure to L-NE (5×10⁻⁵ M) enhanced bacterial proliferation and the expression of oxidative stress genes (oxyR, soxRS), alongside the upregulation of oxidoreductases and autoinducer synthesis genes (luxS). These effects correlated with the enrichment of OMP-degrading proteobacterial families such as Pseudomonadaceae, Rhodocyclaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae.  This study employed high-throughput multi-omics approaches, including metagenomics, to identify redox-responsive microbial genes and pathways across oxidative regimes. The submitted FASTA files represent metagenomic sequences from microbial communities subjected to oxidative perturbations, including L-NE treatment. These datasets provide valuable insight into the molecular basis of stress-induced biocatalysis and inform strategies for environmentally adaptive wastewater treatment.",

    "description": "While the air microbiome and its diversity are essential for human health and ecosystem resilience, comprehensive air microbial diversity monitoring has remained rare, and little is known about the air microbiome’s composition, distribution, or functionality. Here we show that nanopore shotgun sequencing can robustly assess the air microbiome in combination with active air sampling through liquid impingement and tailored computational analysis. We provide laboratory and computational protocols for air microbiome profiling and reliably assess the taxonomic composition of the core air microbiome in both controlled indoor greenhouse environments and natural outdoor environments. Based on de novo assemblies from long sequencing reads, we identify the taxa of several air microbiota down to the species level and annotate their ecosystem functions. Extending our study to urban settings, we conducted a comprehensive air sampling campaign in Barcelona, Spain, revealing distinct microbial communities across various urban locations. As nanopore sequencing for air monitoring can be easily employed, is automatable, fast, and portable for in situ applications worldwide, we envision that this approach can help holistically explore the role of the air microbiome (Reska T. et al., 2024, ISME Commun. 4(1), doi:10.1093/ismeco/ycae099) (Explanation of the files, barcoding scheme, and processing can be found here: https://github.com/ttmgr/Air_Metagenomics/).",

    "description": "Influenza A virus (IAV) poses significant public health challenges due to seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. Its rapid evolution requires continuous monitoring to inform vaccine and antiviral development. Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) offers an unbiased and cost-effective approach to track infectious diseases, including dynamics and genomic evolution. We developed a novel primer panel for genomic WBS of IAV, targeting surface protein segments (HA, NA, M) of circulating H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. Using this panel, we sequenced nucleic acid extracts from 59 wastewater samples from Switzerland during the 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 winter seasons. We found a significant correlation between clinical and wastewater-based abundance estimates of the dominant H1N1 clades in the 2023/2024 season. Additionally, we detected mutations in vaccine and drug target sites, aligning with clinical data. Our findings demonstrate that Influenza A evolution, including acquisition of mutations relevant to vaccine and antiviral strategies, can be effectively derived through wastewater-based surveillance.",

    "description": "Public washrooms (toilets) are potential hubs for pathogen transmission, yet the risk of microbial re-contamination via post-handwashing surfaces remains understudied. We characterized the presence and prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the post-handwashing area by collecting surface samples of four high-contact sites (n = 232), including faucets, paper dispensers, hand dryers, and exit door handles, in public washrooms across healthcare, commercial, and recreational facilities. Using culture-dependent methods, we isolated 17 MDROs, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E, n = 10), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA, n = 5), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 2). We novelly employed targeted probe capture metagenomics (TCM) to enrich and sequence low-abundance pathogen and ARG targets, revealing a core microbiome dominated by opportunistic pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. TCM detected clinically critical ARGs (blaCTX-M, blaNDM, blaSHV, blaVIM, mecA, vanC), with mecA, the hallmark of MRSA resistance, ubiquitously prevalent across all sites. Notably, the co-enrichment of S. aureus and mecA on exit door handles suggested their roles as critical hotspots for MRSA dissemination. Our findings highlight post-handwashing areas as underrecognized reservoirs for MDROs, particularly MRSA. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the utility of TCM in public health surveillance by enabling sensitive detection of rare but high-risk resistance determinants in low-biomass environmental samples. Integrating culture-based and metagenomic approaches, this study offers a comprehensive and nuanced assessment of the microbial and resistome landscape of washroom environments, offering a revolutionizing approach for future environmental surveillance.",

    "description": "Antibiotic treatment for sepsis has an unintended yet crucial consequence: it exerts a bystander effect on the microbiome changing its bacterial composition and resistome. Antimicrobial stewardship aims, in part, to minimise this effect to prevent development of subsequent drug-resistant infection, but data evaluating and quantifying these changes are largely lacking, especially in low-income settings which are disproportionately affected by antimicrobial resistance. Such data are critical to creating evidence-based stewardship protocols.  We address this data gap in Blantyre, Malawi. We used longitudinal sampling of human stool and metagenomic deep sequencing to describe microbiome composition and resistome pre-, during- and post-antimicrobial exposure. We developed Bayesian regression models to link these changes to individual antimicrobial agents. We find that ceftriaxone, in particular, exerts strong off-target effects, both increasing abundance of Enterobacterales, and the prevalence of macrolide and aminoglycoside resistance genes. Simulation from the fitted models allows exploration of different stewardship strategies, and can inform practice in Malawi and elsewhere.",

After culturing, DNA was extracted and sequenced using Nanopore long-read whole metagenome sequencing. Classification was performed using Kraken2, and antibiotic resistance genes were identified using the CARD RGI Resistance Gene Identifier. In total, 10’369’710 reads were generated. In the 15 hand samples, 2’495 species were detected. 99.9% of the samples were identified as bacterial, which indicates a limitation of the extraction methods. The majority of the hand samples belonged to the Staphylococcus genus (69.38%). Significant individual differences were observed in the microbiome composition of each sample. For the surface samples, 22 species that were present in all or almost all surfaces were listed. Among them, many potentially dangerous pathogenic bacteria were identified, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Their antimicrobial resistance genes were also detected in the analyzed sample.",

Here we present findings from a real-world mixed-cancer cohort (Mayo Clinic Cancer Microbiome), comprising 1,364 cancer patients and 287 healthy controls. Using a rigorous framework to account for non-specific microbiome associations with cancer, comorbidities, and clinical variables, we identified 341 cancer-associated species across five cancer classes that represent the most plausible contributors to cancer pathogenesis. Within cancer classes, we found reduced secondary bile acid pathway levels in early-onset breast cancer and elevated Veillonella parvula and stool lactate in early-onset colorectal cancer. Additionally, high levels of Anaerostipes hadrus encoding dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase were protective against 5-fluorouracil-induced diarrhea. These findings demonstrate the strength of our cohort and provide a foundational resource for discovery of cancer-specific microbiome signatures and predictive biomarkers.",

    "description": "Antimicrobial surfaces have the potential to continuously self-decontaminate, which can play a key role in infection control. Various surface treatment sprays available on the market today with different compositions. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of these surface treatment sprays in real-life settings. The effects of the sprays were examined both in vitro, using bacterial suspensions, and in real-life settings. Effectiveness was measured by the number of colony-forming units (CFU) and by ATP tests. Additionally, the microbiome of one door opener was sequenced to identify the predominant microbes on that surface. Sequencing revealed that the microbiome of the door openers is mainly composed of skin bacteria. Staphylococcus (49.2%) and Micrococcus (33.6%) were the dominant genera identified in the sample. In vitro tests demonstrated that all spray treatments significantly reduced the survival of E. coli on the surfaces. However, in real-life settings, none of our measurements detected a significant reduction in microbial presence following spray treatment. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is due to the presence of a fatty substance, likely from fingerprints, on surfaces. This oily layer may act as a biofilm that physically separates microbes from the treated surfaces, thereby diminishing the efficacy of the antimicrobial sprays.",

    "description": "While therapeutic antibiotic use directly impacts the evolution of AntiMicrobial Resistance (AMR), it has become increasingly clear that the environmental dimension of AMR is also of great importance. We postulate that urban water systems (UWS), which are our receptacle for excreted antimicrobials, AMR organisms and AMR genes, are central conduits of AMR to and from pathogens and environmental strains. This is because of high microbial densities and the co-mingling of different wastes, which promotes accelerated AMR gene transfer (HGT) and multi-resistance due to the cooccurrence of antibiotics, biocides, metals and microbes. In DARWIN, we will undertake a never-previously-performed pan-European examination of the fate of key AMR organisms and genetic determinants in UWSs resulting from discharged hospital and community wastes, including transmission mechanisms in different stages of sewer catchments and receiving waters. We focus on the spread of AMR genes encoding clinically relevant extended spectrum β-lactam (ESBL) and carbapenem resistance in three countries with differing AMR profiles and sewage management practices. We postulate that AMR genes readily transmit in UWSs from pathogens and commensal hosts in human wastes (after antibiotic use) to environmental strains better adapted to migrate through the sewer environment, which is driven by local ecologies, conjugal plasmid transfer and phage-mediated transduction. Hence, we will, for the first time, determine specific bacterial hosts that carry AMR genes across UWSs, and identify where key HGT events occur with the ultimate goal of assessing the relative risk of AMR genes returning back to humans due to environmental exposure. To guide risk assessments, a predictive dynamic mathematical model for UWSs will bedeveloped to assist in health and sewage management decisions.",

    "description": "Air quality is monitored through networks of integrated measuring stations, which employ, among 18 others, high-volume air samplers (HVS) for the collection of particulate matter (PM) on filters. 19 Those filters undergo analysis of primarily PM2.5 or PM10 concentration (μg/m3) and a limited 20 number of regulated toxic metals. The biological composition of those collected particles is often 21 overlooked despite its significant relevance for human health. 22 In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using filters from HVS for the analysis of bioaerosols 23 and developed an efficient DNA extraction method for ultra-low biomass air samples, ensuring 24 sufficient quantity and quality of genetic material for metagenomic sequencing analysis. We 25 explored the impacts of sampling duration, particle size selection, and filter materials on microbial 26 diversity of samples collected by HVS and compared it to a well-established bioaerosol sampler, 27 SASS 3100. 28 The study emphasises the HVS's effectiveness in capturing the predominant species in the air 29 microbiome and underline the need of implementing blank samples alongside aerosol samples 30 during analysis. 31 The study provides valuable insights into the potential use of HVS for airborne microbiome 32 characterization, highlighting the feasibility of integrating bioaerosol analysis into regular 33 monitoring stations to enable a more holistic assessment of air quality.",

    "description": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global public health, necessitating comprehensive surveillance of resistant pathogens in the environment. This study presents a comprehensive regional comparison of microbial diversity and AMR profiles in wastewater across three distinct regions of Maharashtra, India. We conducted high-throughput nanopore sequencing to generate 56.99 Gbp of data from 138 wastewater samples. Bioinformatic analysis was employed to characterize microbial communities and examine regional variations in microbial abundance at the genus level. Specific marker taxa associated with AMR were identified in each region, revealing distinct resistance patterns across drug classes, including multidrug, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, beta-lactam, tetracycline, and bacitracin. Certain bacterial taxa exhibited a high propensity for resistance to specific antibiotic groups, offering insights for targeted AMR monitoring. The prevalence of key AMR genes in WHO-priority pathogens was quantified, highlighting emerging resistance trends in genes such as mdr(ABC), macB, acrB, and sul1. These findings demonstrate that wastewater monitoring is an effective tool for tracking AMR dynamics, pathogen abundance, and gene dissemination over time. The study underscores the need for integrated AMR surveillance frameworks to better understand environmental resistance dissemination and inform public health strategies to address the growing AMR crisis.",

The combined AHLs+ME strategy achieved a 79.50% increase in cumulative methane production compared to the control, outperforming individual treatments. This enhancement was attributed to accelerated substrate degradation, selective enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanobrevibacter, Methanobacterium, Methanofollis), and strengthened quorum sensing, electron transfer, and methane synthesis pathways. Metagenomic analysis revealed abundance upregulation of key genes involved in AHL synthesis (bjaI, rpaI, braI, rhiI) and sensing (solR, cepR, tofR), direct interspecies electron transfer (pilA, mtrC), and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (ftr, mvhD, vhuD, vhcD).

It is proposed to mix part of the secondary influent with the secondary effluent into the biofilter, and then realize part of the short-course denitrification coupled with anaerobic ammonia oxidation in the biofilter to provide the carbon source required for the short-course denitrification reaction and NH4+-N required for the anaerobic ammonia oxidation reaction in the secondary influent, so as to realize the purpose of energy saving and consumption reduction. In addition, by adding Mn(II) and inoculating manganese oxidizing bacteria, biomanganese oxides are generated to oxidize some of the difficult-to-degrade organic matter in the secondary effluent water, which can be formed into readily degradable organic matter to be used as a carbon source by denitrifying bacteria, and optimize the process operating parameters, which can further improve the effluent water quality under the premise of ensuring that the effluent water quality meets the standards.",

    "description": "Urban public transport systems, particularly metro networks, serve as key hubs for microbial transmission, yet the urban microbiome in densely populated regions like India remains poorly characterized. These environments harbor diverse microbial communities, including both beneficial and pathogenic species, which can influence public health. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need to monitor microbial ecosystems, particularly with respect to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes that may have escalated due to increased antibiotic use during health crises. In a first-of-its-kind study in India, we comprehensively characterized microbial communities and the prevalence of AMR genes in the Chennai Metro system. Of the 96 surface swab samples collected from 12 stations across two metro lines, 47 samples passed quality control and were subsequently analyzed using whole genome metagenomic sequencing. Comparative analysis with global urban microbiome datasets revealed distinct microbial profiles, including eight core species unique to Chennai. Surface type significantly influenced microbial diversity, with kiosks displaying the highest diversity levels. While AMR gene presence was minimal overall, genes associated with Sulfonamide and Rifamycin resistance were detected. These findings highlight unique microbial signatures and emphasize the need for ongoing surveillance and targeted interventions to mitigate microbial transmission risks in densely populated urban areas.",

    "description": "Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) is a proven tool for monitoring population-level infection events. Wastewater contains high concentrations of inhibitors, which contaminate total nucleic acids (TNA) extracted from these samples. We found that TNA extracts from raw influent of Berlin wastewater treatment plants contained highly variable amounts of inhibitors that impaired molecular analyses like dPCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS). By using dilutions, we were able to detect inhibitory effects. To enhance WBS sensitivity and stability, we applied a combination of PCR inhibitor removal and TNA dilution (PIR+D). This approach led to a 26-fold increase in measured SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, practically reducing the detection limit. Additionally, we observed a substantial increase in stability of the time series. We define suitable stability as a mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.1 log10 copies/l and a geometric mean relative absolute error (GMRAE) below 26%. Using PIR+D, the MAE could be reduced from 0.219 to 0.097 and the GMRAE from 65.5% to 26.0% and even further in real-world WBS. Furthermore, PIR+D improved SARS-CoV-2 genome alignment and coverage in amplicon-based NGS for low to medium concentrations. In conclusion, we strongly recommend both the monitoring and removal of inhibitors from samples for WBS. Overall design: Communal wastewater of three wastewater treatment plants (EU UWW Codes: Ruhleben DETP_BE01, Schönerlinde DETP_BE02, Waßmannsdorf DETP_BE03) in Berlin and the airport BER was collected from raw influent. Samples were collected during low SARS-CoV-2 levels (February/March 2024) and high levels (September 2024). Total TNA was extracted and then, with or without inhibitor removal, subjected to high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 sequencing.",

    "description": "High diarrheal disease burden remains an urgent concern in low- and middle-income countries, greatly affecting children under the age of 5 years old and those living with HIV and AIDS. Treatment of infectious diseases has also become increasingly difficult with the rapid rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Environmental surveillance of wastewater can supplement gaps in clinical surveillance as residents on a sewage system contribute to the wastewater, providing simple, composite samples that can improve understanding about both pathogens and AMR in the community. This study evaluated the effectiveness of environmental surveillance with shotgun metagenomics as a tool to characterize a broad range of enteric pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes, and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in wastewater from six neighborhoods in Harare, Zimbabwe. Alpha and beta diversity of the microbial community were similar between high-income and low-income suburbs. Enteric pathogens of high AMR and clinical concern, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica, were detected in all samples. The top VFGs encoded for delivery, adherence, and motility, functions important in toxin secretion, colonization, and immune modulation. The findings provide a foundation for future studies to explore environmental surveillance and shotgun metagenomics as a public health monitoring tool for enteric diseases.",

    "description": "Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a significant global health issue. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contain diverse bacterial communities, including pathogens, and have been identified as crucial reservoirs for the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. The present study aimed to identify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and screen for the presence of mutations associated with antibiotic resistance in Legionella pneumophila and Aeromonas spp. strains from municipal wastewater. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to characterise the genomes of L. pneumophila and Aeromonas spp. and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in these genomes. A total of 138 nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in seven genes associated with drug resistance and one deletion mutation in the lpeB gene were identified in L. pneumophila. In Aeromonas spp. strains, two (aph(6)-Id and aph(3)-Ib) and five (blaMOX-4, blaOXA-1143, blaOXA-724, cepH, and imiH) ARGs conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and b-lactams were identified, respectively. Moreover, this study presents b-lactam resistance genes, blaOXA-1143 and blaOXA-724, for the first time in Aeromonas spp. strains from a municipal WWTP. In conclusion, these findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms through which clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria such L. pneumophila and Aeromonas spp. found in natural environments like municipal wastewater, acquire drug resistance.",

    "description": "The spread and transmission of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, have become a significant global concern. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be released into the environment through various human excretions, it provides a critical opportunity for early detection and identification within a population through the use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). With the rapid progress in the application of WBE during the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been able to provide evidence of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in wastewater and aid in decision-making for public health measures. However, there is a lack of research on potential trends and correlations between different levels of wastewater sample analysis, from building-level to municipality-level. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap and also explore the use of metagenomic analysis in addition to RNA concentration in wastewater samples for COVID-19 monitoring at the building level. Results from monitoring indicated consistent patterns of COVID-19 and variants at the building, community, and municipality levels. However, there was a statistical difference in transmission dynamics at the building level during the spring season, possibly due to localized factors. Thus, the comparison of monitoring data from COVID-19 across different sewage catchment areas plays a crucial role in understanding the geographical spread of COVID-19. Metagenome analysis revealed a predominance of gut-associated microbes in wastewater, but no significant seasonal variations were observed. Further research is necessary to fully understand the relationship between changes in the gut microbiome and the distribution of COVID-19. Monitoring of the gut microbiome in wastewater may serve as a valuable addition to early warning systems for COVID-19 outbreaks.",

    "description": "The treatment of expressway service area sewage (ESAS) confronts great challenges owing to its unique characteristics of high ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentrations and low carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio. In order to address the issue, an anoxic-oxic moving bed biofilm reactor (AO-MBBR) system was continuously started up for 60 days to explore the potential influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the contaminant removal for ESAS in this study. The HRT had no striking influence on organic degradation performance, the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was increased by 17.73% accompanied by extending HRT. The denitrifiers Thiothrix and Trichococcus were dominant genus when HRT were 13.5h and 18h respectively. The neutral community model showed that the stochastic processes was crucial in shaping the assembly of microbial communities during the operation. Besides, a closer collaborative relationship between key genus was built as HRT increased, which ensured the stable pollutant removal efficiency of the system. Overall, this work provided a new idea and illustrated the intrinsic role of HRT for the ESAS treatment.",

Samples of carcasses, breast and caeca content were collected at the slaughterhouse between 33-35 days (T4). In addition, samples of human faeces, human skin, clothing and worker environment were collected and sequenced as pool only by shotgun metagenomics. After identifying bacterial taxa associated to the poultry house showing the better biosafety infrastructures, one nutritional intervention was conducted (i.e., intervention phase) to increase their relative abundance in the animals reared in all tested poultry houses. In the  intervention phase, 461 samples were collected and sequenced by 16s rRNA gene and 306 samples by shotgun metagenomics following the same experimental and sampling scheme.

From Site 1 (S1, farrowing unit – piglets from birth to 24±2 days of age), 4 pigs (2 males and 2 females) from 24 litters were selected. Piglets from S1 were equally allocated to two Sites 2 (S2, weaning units) and subsequently to two Sites 3 (S3, growing-finishing units). S2 and S3 were selected for their historical productivity, with good (H group) or poor (L group) scores. Fecal and environmental samples (i.e. environmental swabs, air, drinking water, soil and wastewater) were collected from pigs at six stages: 17 days (T1), 38-40 days (T2), 74-80 days (T3), 90-101 days (T4), and 272-279 days (T5), 291-298 days of life (T6, slaughterhouse).

Of critical practical importance is the ability to identify microbial DNA sequences in frozen tissue specimens. Here, we compare four existing commercial methods and two newly introduced methods involving chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on frozen human and pig intestinal biopsies. We find that all methods that rely on differential lysis of host and microbial cells introduce substantial biases as assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon profiling. However, ChIP enables 10-fold enrichment of microbial DNA while introducing less bias, sufficient to make assessment possible against background, in both pigs and humans. We recommend ChIP in situations where host depletion is important but where minimizing taxonomic bias is essential, and the MolYsis or Zymo kit for situations where host depletion level is more important than taxonomic bias.",

This successful operation at low temperatures along with microbial community confirmation, the prevalence of psychrotolerant communities was observed throughout long-term reactor operation, indicating the long-term adaptation of the microbial community in granulated biomass through changes in the community structure and low temperature anaerobic treatment potential in pilot and/or full-scale application for treating municipal wastewater.",

We hypothesize that sensitivity (enhanced detection and recovery) can be improved by optimizing sampling and concentration strategies, and that specificity (viral strain identification for epidemiologic tracking) can be improved by optimizing wastewater detection methods. The results from this proposal will develop and deploy experimental and informatics infrastructure and operations, provide a proof-of-concept implementation to use wastewater for infectious disease surveillance, and advance work towards a model capable of predicting local and community level spread of COVID-19 and emerging pathogens based upon measurements of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses from wastewater.",

    "description": "Wastewater is a valuable source for monitoring contaminants of biotic or abiotic origin. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a public health threat that consists of the ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of antimicrobial compounds, rendering them very difficult or impossible to eradicate in case of infection. Considering the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) to a wide number of ecosystems, there is a need for the identification of hotspots that concentrate antimicrobial resistance determinants. A comprehensive investigation conducted at a city-scale in Sabadell (Barcelona, Spain) has integrated both phenotypic and genotypic methodologies, including metagenomics and culture-based techniques coupled with whole-genome sequencing (WGS), to monitor ARG presence in seven different spots of the sewage system. Metagenomics approach identified 262 ARG variants across analyzed sampling sites, grouped into 15 resistance categories. The most prevalent ARGs were macrolides-lincosamides-class B streptogramins (MLSB) (35.1%) and beta-lactams (28.7%), including carbapenems (5.9%) and cephalosporins (5.3%). MLSB resistance featured dominant msr(E) and mph(E) genes, the most abundant ARGs in our study. ARGs conferring resistance to beta-lactam were dominated by blaOXA-464, blaOXA-491, and blaNPS. Key genes for carbapenem (blaOXA-372, blaKPC-2) and cephalosporin (blaOXA-10, blaOXA-1) resistance were identified. The hospital sector exhibited the highest relative abundance of ARGs, dominated by beta-lactams, MLSB, and aminoglycosides. Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) entrance points and residential areas displayed similar ARG profiles, while WWTP effluent and industrial zones had the lowest ARG levels. WWTP significantly reduced ARG presence (93.3%). The characterization of antibiotic-resistant bacterial isolates found that most abundant ARGs were predominantly plasmid-borne, favoring ARG spread across bacterial genera. This finding confirmed the significant role of plasmids in ARG dissemination, increasing both diversity and prevalence within waterborne bacterial communities. City-scale surveillance programs can play a pivotal role in guiding effective measures to reduce the dissemination of AMR and mitigate their environmental impact.",

    "description": "In the face of mounting global plastic pollution, especially concerning microplastics, to which biodegradation must be a sustainable solution. The key factor driving this technology is to explore efficient plastic-biodegraders from different habitats, among which activated sludge (AS) may be an important option since it holds diverse microorganisms occupying various ecological niches. Here we intend to enrich the plastic-degrading microorganisms from AS by using polyethylene (PE) plastic as the carbon and energy source. After a 28-day incubation, the weight loss of PE films reached 3% and the hydrophobicity decreased, indicating physical biodegradation. Moreover, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results showed the formation of several new oxygen-containing functional groups on PE. Microbial analysis extracted 26 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the enriched microbial communities. Among them MAG10, MAG21 and MAG26 displayed the increased abundance upon PE addition and harbored abundant genes related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism, suggesting their potential to degrade PE. Additionally, functional analysis revealed 14 plastic degradation-related genes, including oxidase, laccase, and lipase, indicating the significant potential in plastic degradation. Furthermore, a pathway for synergistic biodegradation of PE was proposed based on the potential PE degradation genes retrieved from MAGs. This work offers a promising and sustainable solution to plastic pollution by enriching the potential biodegradators from AS.",

    "description": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to human, veterinary, and agricultural health. AMR can be directly selected for by antibiotics, and indirectly co-selected for by biocides and metals. Some evidence suggests that non-antibiotic drugs (NADs) can co-select for AMR, but previous work focused on exposing single model bacterial species to predominately high concentrations of NADs. Here, we determined the antimicrobial effect and selective potential of three commonly used NADs against a complex bacterial community using a combination of culture based, metagenomic, and metratranscriptomic approaches. We found that three of five NADs tested on growth significantly reduced growth of a bacterial community, although only one (17-β-estradiol) selected for an AMR marker using qPCR. Whole metagenome sequencing indicated that there was no clear strong selection by NADs for antibiotic resistance genes, nor effects on community composition. However, some changes in relative abundance of metal resistance genes were observed after exposure to diclofenac, metformin, and 17-β-estradiol. Together, these results indicate that the NADs tested likely do not strongly select for AMR at both clinically and environmentally relevant concentrations.",

    "description": "Although emerging evidences suggest an association between the altered gut microbiota and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), little is known about the potential mechanisms that linked the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and the development of CAP. In this study, we performed a metagenome-wide association study of 32 CAP patients and 36 health controls, which identified significant alterations in gut microbiota and dysbiosis-related metabolomics associated with CAP occurrence. We identified gut microbial alterations associated with CAP and linked to the changes in stool metabolites. Fecal metabolite profiles revealed that CAP patients exhibited a notable increase in Arachidonic acid, but a decrease in deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid compared to control groups. Short-chain fatty acid-producing genera, including Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, and Eubacterium, and species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Eubacterium rectale, Prevotella copri, and Ruminococcus bromii, were significantly delepleted in CAP patients relative to those in control groups. Bacterial co-occurrence network analysis revealed that pro-inflammatory bacteria were over-represented and became to the core gut microbiome in CAP patients. These microbial and metabolic signatures are closely associated in CAP patients and control group. In conclusion, we identified bile acids (BAs) insufficiency, imbalanced production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and excessive metabolic inflammation as gut microbiota-driven mechanisms linked to CAP. This work might explain in part the mechanistic link between altered gut microbiota and CAP pathogenesis.",

Analyzing two filter types in winter and summer allowed us to investigate the effects of operational conditions, including temperature, backwashing cycle, and empty bed contact time on organic matter removal, microbial activity, and bacterial taxonomy and functionality profiles in consecutive full-scale biological active filters. Metagenomics sequencing of the full 16S rRNA gene was undertaken on the filters' media samples before and after backwashing and during air scouring. This analysis was employed to achieve a more comprehensive quantification of OTU profiles and to discern the functionality of the bacterial community in biological active filters while also assessing the impact of backwashing on the taxonomy and functionality of the bacterial community. The 16S rRNA V4-V5 region amplicon sequencing was conducted on both water and BAFs' media samples across seasons to understand the microbial transfer dynamics between the water matrix and the filter media.",

    "title": "Clearing the air on pollutant disruptions of the gut-brain axis: Developmental exposure to Benzo[a]pyrene disturbs zebrafish behavior and the gut microbiome in adults and subsequent generations",
    "description": "Developmental exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, has been linked to various toxic effects, including neurodegenerative disorders and, most recently, multigenerational behavioral impairment. While the specific mechanisms driving BaP neurotoxicity are not fully understood, recent work highlights two important determinants of developmental BaP neurotoxicity: (1) the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which is responsible for inducing host metabolism of BaP, and (2) the gut microbiome, which may interact with BaP to affect its metabolism, or be perturbed directly by BaP to yield disruptions to the gut-brain axis. To explore the role of AHR, the gut microbiome, and their interaction on BaP-induced neurotoxicity, we utilized the zebrafish model. We sought to determine (1) how exposure to BaP and developmental expression of AHR2, a key gene in the zebrafish AHR pathway, link to adult zebrafish behavior, (2) how these same variables associated with the structure and function of the adult zebrafish gut metagenome, and (3) whether these associations were multigenerational. This finding revealed a reticulated axis of association between BaP exposure, developmental AHR2 expression, the zebrafish gut metagenome, and behavior. Our results also indicate that AHR2 is a key mediator of how BaP elicits neurotoxicity and microbiome dysbiosis. Additionally, this axis of association manifests inter- and transgenerationally, suggesting that exposure to BaP may yield dysbiotic and neurodevelopmental impacts on subsequent generations. These findings demonstrate the power of utilizing the zebrafish model to study pollutant-metagenome interactions and elucidate the role of specific host genes in the neurotoxicity and dysbiosis.",

    "description": "University dormitories represent densely populated environments, and washing machines are po-tential sites for the spread of bacteria and microbes. However, the extent of antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) variation in washing machines within university dormitories and their potential health risks are largely unknown. To disclose the occurrence of ARGs and antibiotic-resistant bacteria from university dormitories, we collected samples from washing machines in 10 dormi-tories and used metagenomic sequencing technology to determine microbial and ARG abundance. Our results showed abundant microbial diversity, with Proteobacteria being the dominant mi-croorganism that harbors many ARGs. The majority of the existing ARGs were associated with antibiotic target alteration and efflux, conferring multidrug resistance. We identified tnpA and IS91 as the most abundant mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in washing machines, and found that Micavibrio aeruginosavorus, Aquincola tertiaricarbonis, and Mycolicibacterium iranicum had high levels of ARGs. The composition of resistance genes was strongly associated with different bacte-rial types, but only minor variations in bacterial community and ARGs were observed between females and males. However, due to limitations in sample size, further study is needed to confirm any potential gender differences. Our study highlights the potential transmission of pathogens from washing machines to humans and the surrounding environment. Pollution in washing ma-chines poses a severe threat to public health and demands attention. Therefore, it is crucial to explore effective methods for reducing the reproduction of multidrug resistance.",

    "description": "Increasing demand for poultry has spurred poultry production in low- and middle-income countries like Mozambique. Poultry may be an important source of foodborne, antimicrobial resistant bacteria to consumers in settings with limited water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure. The ChEEP ChEEP (Chicken Exposures and Enteric Pathogens in Children Exposed through Environmental Pathways) study was conducted in Maputo City, Mozambique from 2019-2021 to quantify enteric pathogen exposures along the supply chain for commercial and local (i.e. scavenger) chicken breeds. Here, we performed metagenomic sequencing of total DNA from banked ChEEP ChEEP samples to characterize fecal and carcass microbiome and resistome diversity between chicken breeds and along the supply chain. Fecal samples (26) were collected from commercial and local chickens at production sites and markets, and carcass (49) and rinse bucket samples (26) from markets. We conducted taxonomic profiling and identified antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) from metagenomic sequence data, focusing especially on known human pathogens and high-risk ARGs. We estimated alpha diversity for each sample and compared by site and breed. We estimated Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between samples and examined clustering. We found that commercial and local chickens harbored distinct fecal pathogens and resistomes at production and market sites. Many bacterial pathogens and ARGs present in chicken fecal samples are also present on carcasses sold to consumers. Finally, commercial chicken carcasses contain high-risk ARGs that are not necessarily introduced from chicken feces. These results indicate markets are an important site of pathogen and ARG exposure.",

To determine the genetic basis of its duality, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of 813 B. fragilis strains, representing both commensal and pathogenic origins. Our findings reveal that pathogenic strains emerge across diverse phylogenetic lineages, due in part to rapid gene exchange and the adaptability of the accessory genome. We identified 16 phylogenetic groups, differentiated by genes associated with capsule composition, interspecies competition, and host interactions. A microbial genome-wide association study identified 44 genes linked to extra-intestinal survival and pathogenicity.

Many studies have attempted to identify ways of modulating microbial communities within built environments to promote health. None have explored how these complex communities assemble initially, following construction of new built environments. This study used high-throughput targeted sequencing approaches to explore bacterial community acquisition and development in a single structure. Microbial sampling spanned from site identification, through the construction process to commissioning and use. Commissioning the building significantly reduced bacterial richness, diversity and community structure. Outdoor environments exhibited greater longitudinal community stability than indoor environments. Community flux in indoor environments was associated with human interventions driving environmental selection which increased in indoor environments following commissioning. A reduction in outdoor community influence on indoor microbiotas was also observed. Indoor communities became enriched with human associated genera such as Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella. These data represent the first to characterize the initial assembly of bacterial communities in built environments and will inform future studies aiming to modulate built environment microbiota.",

    "description": "Background Antimicrobial resistance has been identified as a major threat to global health. The pig food chain is considered an important source of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). However, there is still a lack of knowledge focusing on the spread dispersion of ARGs from in pig production units to thesystem, including the external environment. Results In the present study, we longitudinally followed two one swine farmsfarm located in Italy from the weaning phase to the slaughterhouse to comprehensively assess the diversity of ARGs, their diffusion, and the bacteria associated with them. We obtained shotgun metagenomic sequences from 294 samples, including pig feces, farm environment, soil around the farm, wastewater, and slaughterhouse environment. We identified a total of 530 species-level genome bins (SGBs), which allowed us to assess the dispersion of microorganisms and their associated ARGs in the farm system. Specifically, wWe identified 309 SGBs being shared able to spread frombetween the the animals gut microbiome, the internal and external farm environments to the soil surrounding the farms. Specifically, these SGBs were characterized by a diverse and complex resistome, with ARGs active against 18 different classes of antibiotic compounds, well matching antibiotic use in the pig food chain in Europe. Conclusions Collectively, our results highlight the urgency to implement more effective countermeasures to limit the spread dispersion of ARGs from in the pig food systems and the relevance of metagenomics-based approaches to monitor the spread of ARGs for the safety of the farm working environment and the surrounding ecosystems.  This work was carried out in the context of the “Controlling Microbiomes Circulations for Better Food Systems” (CIRCLES) project, which was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 818290.",

The current surveillance data from different parts of the country especiallyfrom Faridabad, Haryana will help to precisely monitor and characterize the distributionof emerging bacterial pathogens and their AMR profile which are important for trackingchanges in resistance patterns in the microbes living in the environment over time and wouldbe of national and global priorities. This sewage-based surveillance is likely to providepredictive possibilities for many pathogens thereby providing important insights in publichealth policy. Assessing the pathogen load in the sewage water and identifying new kinds ofAMR functions and their genetic linkage with mobile genetic elements will reduce the risk ofany potential outbreaks of resistant pathogens.",

Specimens in the specimen pool were homogenized separately using a mortar and pestle, resuspended in 1 milliliter of DPBS, and then rapidly frozen and thawed three times on dry ice. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 micron filter (Millipore) to remove eukaryotic and bacterial cell-sized particles, and then 200 microliter of supernatant from each pool was treated with a mixture of nuclease enzymes to reduce the concentration of free (non-viral-encapsulated) nucleic acids. The remaining total nucleic acids were then isolated using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. One library was then constructed using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform with 250 bases paired ends with dual barcoding.",

In this study, ICOB treatment significantly enhanced the removal of Cu2+, Fe3+, and color by 39%, 45%, and 52%, respectively, outperforming biodegradation. Catalytic ozonation effectively breaking down unsaturated organic substances and high-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter into smaller, more biodegradable molecules. Compared with biodegradation, the ICOB system significantly increased the abundances of Pseudomonas, Sphingopyxis, and Brevundimonas by ~96%, ~67%, and ~85%, respectively. These microorganisms, possessing genes for degrading phenol, aromatic compounds, polycyclic aromatics, and sulfur metabolism, further enhanced the mineralization of intermediates. Consequently, the ICOB system outperformed biodegradation and catalytic ozonation treatments, with the effluent exhibited a chemical oxygen demand removal rate of ~58% and a toxicity reduction of ~47%, meeting discharge standards for coking wastewater.",

When elucidating that some infections were caused by bacteria, search fortherapies against these pathogens resulted in the discovery of antibiotics, becomingthe most used form of treatment. However, intense clinical practice in prescribing thesedrugs, in addition to uncontrolled self-medication by the world population, were factorsthat contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. With the rapid spreadof resistance through the transfer of resistance genes between them, especially insewage systems, metagenomic studies make it possible to identify genes in microbialcommunities and discriminate as present local species, as it is an independent methodof cultivation.",

    "description": "This study investigated the diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in faeces. With the large-scale development of modern aquaculture, antibiotics are widely used as growth promoters and disease prevention means. However, this large-scale use also brings a serious problem - the overuse and residue of antibiotics in the farming process, which not only causes environmental pollution, but more importantly, it spawns and accumulates a large number of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the farmed feces. These ARGs can not only be transmitted between the same or different species of bacteria, making bacteria that are sensitive to antibiotics become resistant, thus exacerbating the difficulty of treating bacterial diseases. More notably, these ARGs have the potential to be passed to humans through the food chain, posing a potential threat to human health. Therefore, the aim of this study is to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study on ARGs in cultured feces through advanced molecular biology techniques and bioinformatics analysis. We will conduct an in-depth study of the types, quantities, distribution and transmission mechanisms of ARGs to reveal their diversity and assess the potential risks of these ARGs to the environment and public health. This study will provide a scientific basis for rational use of antibiotics in aquaculture, reducing the production and spread of ARGs, and also provide an important reference for the formulation of effective environmental risk prevention and control strategies.",

Moreover, investigating the dynamics of viral aerosolization in Antarctica is important for understanding the global dispersal of viruses and their potential impacts on distant ecosystems. Monitoring of microbial viruses in Antarctica is essential for tracking community changes over time. Since Antarctica is often considered one of the last pristine environments on Earth, understanding the role of microbial viruses is crucial for developing conservation strategies to protect these pristine ecosystems from potential anthropogenic impacts, including unintentional introduction of foreign microorganisms and viruses.",

    "description": "In this study, coking wastewater was pretreated by activated carbon fiber (ACF) activated eroxymonosulfate (PMS), which in turn enhanced the biological treatment performance in the subsequent sequencing batch reactor (SBR). ACF exhibited superior adsorption and catalytic capabilities, and the removal of COD, phenol (Ph) and chromaticity (chroma) in coking wastewater reached 75.4, 97.8 and 98.3%, respectively, and the BOD5/COD value was 0.82, after 90 min reaction. The organic pollutants in the coking wastewater were gradually degraded by the reactive oxygen species (ROSs) that produced in the ACF/PMS system, and the toxicity of the wastewater was simultaneously reduced. The COD removal efficiency of coking wastewater was increased from 72.9 to 96.7% by ACF/PMS pretreatment combined with SBR biological treatment. The number of functional bacteria in the degradation process of organic pollutants increased significantly and the biodegradability of the wastewater was enhanced after pretreatment with ACF/PMS system.",

To gain a deeper understanding and establish correlations between microbial growth on building surfaces and ornamental lighting, an outdoor pilot study was conducted. This study compared the effects of three lighting conditions:traditional, innovative, and no lighting on prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities.The traditional lighting employed a metal halide lamp, commonly used for illuminating monuments. The innovative lighting system utilized an environmentally friendly prototype lamp called CromaLux, which combined green and amber LEDs with potential biostatic properties aimed at halting biological colonization, particularly by algae and cyanobacteria. This analysis was conducted using metabarcoding with Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (MinION).",

    "description": "Sewage sludge, as carbon-rich byproducts from wastewater treatment, holds significant untapped potential as renewable resource. Upcycling this troublesome waste stream represents great promise in addressing global escalating energy demands through its wide practice of biofuels recovery concurrently. Here, we develop a novel biotechnology to gain renewable high-value liquid bioenergy from sewage sludge in a self-sufficient platform, by directly transforming sludge into medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Our findings suggest that yeast, cheap and readily available commercial powder, would involve ethanol type fermentation in chain elongation to achieve abundant MCFAs production from sewage sludge using electron donors (i.e., ethanol) and acceptors (i.e., short-chain fatty acids) produced in-situ. The abundance and transcription of CE-related genes in this novel sludge fermentation paradigm confirm the efficient self-production capacity of MCFAs with the metabolic network formed by yeast and anaerobic microorganisms. Furthermore, life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis evidence the sustainability and economic competitiveness of this biotechnology. Overall, this work provides insights into high-value energy recovery from sewage sludge independent of additional carbon input, which can be applied in existing anaerobic sludge fermentation infrastructure, as well as to develop new applications in a diverse range of industries.",

    "description": "The phylum Chloroflexota has been found to exhibit high abundance in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, its metabolic role has not been fully explored due to the lack of cultured isolates. To address this gap, we report the taxonomic analysis of 314 dereplicated, medium- and high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)",

Alkali-activated materials are prepared from industrial side streams or natural minerals at low temperature but have similar properties to conventional ceramic filter which is widely used for water disinfection. In this study, alkali-activated foams with different compositions were prepared by using the direct foaming method. Their porosity was adjusted to result similar water permeability as with typical point-of-use ceramic filters. The foams were characterized for their mechanical strength and shrinkage. The optimized foam (based on metakaolin) was coated with colloidal Ag solution and its chemical stability (i.e., leaching of Ag, Na, Si, and Al) was studied. The disinfection performance of the foams with and without Ag were investigated in a 10-week experiment, where clean water was pumped through the foams continuously with a municipal wastewater pulse once per week. The inactivation of Escherichia coli from wastewater was 2.84 log10 for Ag-modified foam, which was 1.27 units higher than blank foam. Moreover, from DNA based methods it was observed that both foams with and without Ag were effective in reducing microbial load from the influent wastewater. Furthermore, the changes in community composition, antibiotic resistome and metal and biocide resistome by the foam with Ag was significant.   The environmental impact of alkali-activated foam compared to conventional ceramic filter was evaluated by life cycle assessment.",

Extracellular DNA (eDNA) can significantly contribute to the horizontal transfer of ARGs, and its evaluation is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the cycle of antimicrobial resistance in the environment. In this work, we explored the influence of anthropogenic water pollution on microbial community and antimicrobial resistome diversity, and on ARG spread. We analysed intracellular DNA and eDNA from wastewater treatment plant effluents and lake surface water in a field study. Additionally, we performed dedicated experiments to assess how anthropogenic pollution impacts the transformation of eDNA (by using Gfp-plasmids carrying ARGs) within a natural microbial community by mixing in different proportions lake and wastewater.",

    "description": "Objective: Early prediction of the disease course is challenging in acute pancreatitis (AP). Here, we investigate whether the orointestinal microbiome affects the course of disease in AP early at admission. Design: Buccal and rectal microbial swabs were collected from 424 AP patients within 72h of hospital admission in 15 European centers. All samples were sequenced by full-length 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Primary endpoint was the association of the orointestinal microbiome with the revised Atlanta classification. Secondary endpoints were mortality, length of hospital stay, and severity (organ failure > 48h and/or occurrence of pancreatic collections requiring intervention) as post-hoc analysis. Multivariate analysis was conducted from normalized microbial and corresponding clinical data to build classifiers for predicting severity. For functional metabolic profiling gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed and normalized enrichment scores calculated. Results: 411 buccal and 391 rectal samples were analyzed. The intestinal microbiome significantly differed for the revised Atlanta classification (Bray-Curtis, p-value = 0.009), mortality (Bray-Curtis, p-value 0.006), length of hospital stay (Bray-Curtis, p= 0.009) and severe vs. non-severe (Bray-Curtis, p-value = 0.008). A classifier for severity with 13 different species and SIRS achieved an AUROC of 85.0%, a positive predictive value of 66.6%, and a negative predictive value of 94% outperforming established severity scores. GSE revealed functional pathway modules suggesting elevated short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production in severe AP. Conclusions: The orointestinal microbiome predicts clinical hallmark features of AP, and SCFAs may be utilized for future diagnostic and therapeutic concepts.",

    "description": "Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) effluents are important sources of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and resistant bacteria that threaten aquatic biota. Antibiotic effects on host-associated microbiomes, spread of ARGs and the consequences for host health are still poorly described. This study investigated changes of the Daphnia magna associated microbiome  exposed to the recalcitrant antibiotic doxycycline under artificial reconstituted lab water media (lab water)  and treated wastewater media. D. magna individual juveniles were exposed for 10 days to treated wastewater with and without doxycycline, and similarly in lab water. We analysed 16S rRNA gene to assess changes in community structure, and quantified ARGs abundances by qPCR from both Daphnia and water (before and after the exposure) and monitored Daphnia offspring production. Daphnia-associated microbiome in WWTP was significantly different from that in lab water, mostly by differences in the relative abundance of the predominant taxa. Results showed that in  lab water, doxycycline impaired Daphnia reproduction and reduced the presence of Limnohabitans sp., which are dominant bacteria of the D. magna-associated microbiome. Contrarily, treated wastewater promoted fecundity and increased diversity and richness of Daphnia-associated microbiome. The detected ARG genes in both lab water and treated wastewater medium included the qnrS1, sul1, and blaTEM,, and the integron-related intI1 gene. The treated wastewater contained about 10 times more ARGs than lab water alone. There was an increase of sul1 in Daphnia cultured in treated wastewater compared to lab water, along with a higher relative abundance of Ideonella, Flavobacterium and Acidovorax, likely candidates of carrying ARGs. In addition, there were signs of a higher biodegradation of doxycycline by microbiomes of treated wastewater in comparison to lab water. Thus, results suggest that Daphnia-associated microbiomes are influenced by their environment, and that bacterial communities present in  treated wastewater are better suited to cope with the effects of antibiotics.",

    "description": "The wastewater microbiome contains a multitude of resistant bacteria of human origin, presenting an opportunity for surveillance of resistance in the general population. However, wastewater microbial communities are also influenced by clinical sources, such as hospitals. Identifying signatures of the community and hospital resistome in wastewater is needed for interpretation and risk analysis. In this study, we compare the resistome and microbiome of hospital, community, and mixed municipal wastewater to investigate how and why the composition of these different sites differ. We conducted shotgun metagenomic analysis on wastewater samples from eight wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), four hospitals, and four community sites in Scotland, using a paired sampling design. Cluster analysis and source attribution random forest models demonstrated that the hospital resistome was distinct from community and WWTP resistomes. Hospital wastewater had a higher abundance and diversity of resistance genes, in keeping with evidence that hospitals act as a reservoir and enricher of resistance. However, this distinctive ‘hospital’ signature appeared to be weak in the resistome of downstream WWTPs, likely due to dilution. We conclude that hospital and community wastewater resistomes differ, with the hospital wastewater representing a reservoir of patient- and hospital environment-associated bacteria. However, this ‘hospital’ signature is transient and does not overwhelm the community signature in the resistome of the downstream WWTP influent.",

Means of improving biogas production are needed both to improve agricultural waste treatment and provide farm income. Researchers studied how this community of microorganisms was affected by the addition of small amounts of air to a digestion of poultry litter as well as treatment with sound produced by underwater speakers. Both aeration and sound enhanced biogas production relative to no treatment while combining these treatments was not as effective as microaeration alone. Early in the experiment, microbial diversity was low with over 80% of microorganisms belonging to just three groups of bacteria. By week 23, the bacterial community was more diverse with many belonging to well-known degraders of plant material. There was also an increase in bacterial groups that produce compounds such as hydrogen and small organic acids that foster the growth of other microorganisms. Microbial diversity continued to increase, and by week 42 there was a great increase in the proportion of methanogens which are microorganisms that produce methane, the major component of biogas. No pronounced shift in the composition of the microbial community were observed due to either air or sound treatment. Rather, microbial diversity was enhanced relative to the control. It is likely that both treatments aid in waste breakdown and improve nutrient availability to promote growth and increase biogas production.",

    "description": "Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a powerful tool for monitoring the emergence and spread viral pathogens at population-scale. Typical Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based methods of quantitative and genomic monitoring of viruses in wastewater provide high sensitivity and specificity. However, these methods are limited to the surveillance of target viruses in a single assay and require prior knowledge of the target genome(s). Metagenomic sequencing methods may represent a target-agnostic approach to viral wastewater monitoring, allowing for the detection of a broad range of target viruses including potentially novel and emerging pathogens. In this study, targeted and untargeted metagenomic sequencing methods were compared with tiled-PCR sequencing for detection and genotyping of viral pathogens in wastewater samples. Deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing was unable to generate sufficient genome coverage of human pathogenic viruses for robust genomic epidemiology, with samples dominated by bacteria. Hybrid-capture enrichment of shotgun libraries for respiratory viruses led to significant increases in genome coverage for a range of targets. Tiled-PCR sequencing led to further improvements in genome coverage compared to hybrid-capture for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, enterovirus D68, norovirus GII and human adenovirus-F41 in wastewater samples. In conclusion, untargeted shotgun sequencing was unsuitable for genomic monitoring of the low virus concentrations in wastewater samples analysed in this study. Hybrid-capture enrichment represented a viable method for simultaneous genomic epidemiology of a range of viral pathogens, while tiled-PCR sequencing provided the optimal genome coverage for individual viruses with the minimum sequencing depth.",

Recruitment of the mothers-to-be took place after the antenatal visit at 33-34 gestational weeks at the Helsinki University Hospital for the assessment of the method of delivery in the period of October 2017 untill June 2018. Mothers were selected after careful screening for health, clinical parameters and presence of pathogens.  Their infants received in the first breast milk feeding a single dose of a diluted fecal sample of their own mothers that had been taken 3 weeks prior to delivery, analyzed and stored appropriately. All infants had an uneventful clinical course during the three-months follow-up, during which fecal samples were collected.  The samples were collected by the parents at home and samples were stored at home at -20°C until being brought to the lab in frozen form. Upon receival the samples were immediately stored at -80°C until processing. Fecal DNA was generated by repeated beat beating method and stool WGS metagenomes were generated using Illumina Nextera Flex or iGenomX Riptide High Throughput Rapid Library Prep Kit and Illumina HiSeq and NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platforms respectively.

    "description": "As their names suggest, honey bee viruses such as Deformed wing virus (DWV), Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) are etiological agents of specific diseases in honey bees. They also have been linked with the ongoing decline in honey bee populations worldwide. A rapid, simple, semi-automated, high-throughput, and cost-effective method of screening colonies for viruses would benefit bee research and the beekeeping industry. Here we describe a new approach that combines an RNA-grade liquid homogenizer followed by magnetic bead capture for total virus nucleic acid extraction. We compare it to the commonly applied nucleic acid column-based purification method and use qPCR plus Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing to evaluate the accuracy of analytical results for both of the methods. Our results showed high reproducibility and accuracy for both of the approaches. The semi-automated method described here allows for faster screening of viral loads in units of 96 samples at a time. We developed this method to monitor viral loads in honey bee colonies but it could be easily applied for any PCR or genomic-based screening assays.",

    "description": "Sustainable approaches to circular economy in animal agriculture are still poorly developed.Here, we report an approach to reduce gaseous emissions of CO2 and NH3 from animalhousing while simoultaneously using them to produce value-added biomass. To this end, acone-shaped, helical photobioreactor was developed that can be integrated into animal housing by being freely suspended, thereby combining a small footprint with a physically robust design. The photobioreactor was coupled with the exhaust air of a chicken house to allow continuous cultivation of a mixed culture of Arthrospira spec. (Spirulina). Continuous quantification of CO2 and NH3 concentration showed that the coupled algae reactor effectively purifies the exhaust air from the chicken house while producing algal biomass. Typical production rates of greater than 0.3 g/l*d dry mass were obtained and continuous operation was possible for several weeks. Morphological, biochemical and genomic characterization of Spirulina cultures yielded insights into the dynamics and metabolic processes of the microbial community. We anticipate that further optimization of this approach will provide new opportunities for the generation of value-added products from gaseous CO2 and NH3 waste emissions, linking resource-efficient production of microalgae with simultaneous sequestration of animal emissions",

    "description": "Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a common and potentially severe complication following pancreas surgery. To date, there is no objective predictor anticipating the occurrence of POPF. Here, we aim to prospectively evaluate the orointestinal microbiome as predictor for POPF. In total 105 patients were recruited prospectively before elective pancreas surgery. To this end, buccal, and rectal swabs were collected (in total 203 samples). After excluding patients with delayed surgery (> 1 week after recruitment) and pancreatectomy, as well as all samples that had not reached the desired sequencing depth, 75 buccal and 70 rectal samples (n= 75) were included in the subsequent analysis. Microbial composition was determined by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. For buccal samples 16S rRNA sequencing, and for rectal swabs metagenomic sequencing was performed. Out of 75 buccal samples 19 were collected from patients with type B or C fistula (rPOPF), and 56 showed biochemical leak (BL) or no fistula (nPOPF). Out of 70 rectal samples, 17 were collected from patients belonging to rPOPF. Significant differences between groups were detected for β-diversity (unweighted UniFrac p-value = 0.003) and α-diversity (observed species, p-value 0.004) in buccal but not rectal swabs. Notably, even after incorporation of 67 potentially confounding variables, the results remain significant (p-value = 0.002). Interestingly, the body-mass index (BMI) was the most obvious confounding factor. Four species were found to be differentially abundant in the relevant fistula group: Streptococcus gorondii, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Gemella sanguinis. Building a model with these species and the BMI resulted in an AUROC of 94.2 %. This combined model outperforms BMI alone (86.5 %) and species alone (78.6 %) Our results show that POPF can be predicted by the oral microbiome in combination with BMI.",

    "description": "The widespread occurrence of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance within humans, animals and environment continuum considered in the One Health approach, motivates the development of sensitive and accurate detection and quantification methods. Metagenomics and quantitative PCR (qPCR) are amongst the most used approaches, and often employed for distinct purposes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of metagenomics and qPCR analyses to screen antibiotic resistance genes in animal faecal, wastewater and water samples. Water and wastewater samples were from hospital effluent, from two treatment plants at different treatment stages, and from the receiving river up- and downstream the discharge point. The animal faecal samples were from varying mixture of pig and chicken faeces. Antibiotic resistance gene coverage, sensitivity, and usefulness of the quantitative information produced were analysed and discussed. While both methods were able to distinguish the distinct resistome profiles and detect the gradient stepwise mixture of pig and chicken faeces, qPCR presented higher sensitivity for the detection of a number of antibiotic resistance genes in water/wastewater. In addition, qPCR had higher accuracy when predicted and observed antibiotic resistance gene quantification values were compared. Metagenomics analyses, while less sensitive, were able to provide a markedly higher coverage of antibiotic resistance genes compared to qPCR in all samples. The results highlight the complementarity of both methods and show the importance of the selecting the best method according to the study purpose.",

We explored the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the hospital wastewater (HWW) of nine hospitals in Benin and Burkina Faso, two low-income countries in West Africa, with shotgun metagenomic sequencing. For comparison, we also studied six hospitals in Finland. The highest sum of the relative abundance of ARGs in the 68 HWW samples was detected in Benin and the lowest in Finland. HWW resistomes and mobilomes in Benin and Burkina Faso resembled more of each other than those in Finland. Many carbapenemase genes were detected in varying abundances, especially in HWW from Burkina Faso and Finland. The blaGES genes, the most widespread carbapenemase gene in the Beninese HWW, were also found in water intended for hand-washing and in a puddle at the hospital yard in Benin. mcr genes were detected in the HWW of all three countries, with mcr-5 being the most common mcr gene. These and other mcr genes were observed in very high relative abundances, even in treated wastewater in Burkina Faso and a street gutter in Benin. The results highlight the importance of wastewater treatment, with particular attention to HWW.",

All filters revealed also the presence of plant microbiome due to dust derived from chow and bedding. Surprisingly, however, control filter exhibited the presence of mouse pathogens, despite the absence of mice, suggesting that contaminated connecting pipes could be responsible for this unexpected result. Conversely, the filter from SPF colony revealed the absence of pathogens.",

The 58 cloacal swabs were randomly pooled into 4 specimen pools, each including 14 or 15 cloacal swabs. The cloacal swabs pools were individually resuspended in 1 mL DPBS, and then frozen and thawed rapidly three times on dry-ice. The supernatants were then collected after centrifugation (10 min, 15,000 g). Supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-mm filter (Millipore) to remove eukaryotic- and bacterial cell-sized particles, and 200 uL of supernatant from each pool was then subjected to a mixture of nuclease enzymes to reduce the concentration of free (non-viral encapsidated) nucleic acids. Remaining total nucleic acid was then isolated using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit according to manufacturer's protocol. Eleven libraries were then constructed using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the HiSeq Illumina platform with 250 bases paired ends with dual barcoding for each pool.",

    "title": "How deep ectomycorrhizae can go? A case study down to 4-meters in a Brazilian eucalyptus plantation",
    "description": "The experiment was conducted in the Itatinga research station of the University of São Paulo in Brazil (23°02′S, 48°38′W). The climate is subtropical humid with a mean annual rainfall of 1360 mm and a mean temperature of 19°C (with a seasonal cold and dry period between June and September). The soil is a deep Ferralsol developed on Cretaceous sandstone. In brief, this is a highly weathered soil, dominated by the sand fraction, with a clay content ranging from 15% in the top soil to 20-25% in deep soil layers. Soil pH is acidic and nutrient contents are low.A split-plot experimental design was set up in 2010 with a highly productive Eucalyptus grandis clone (provided by the Suzano Company, Brazil).  In brief, six treatments (three fertilization regimes x two water regimes) were applied in three blocks. The area of individual subplots was 864 m2, with 144 trees at a spacing of 2 x 3 m. Our study was carried out for one modality of fertilization (non-limiting tree growth) representative of the silviculture in commercial eucalypt plantations (12 g N m-2, 3.3 g P m-2, 17.5 g K m-2, 200 g m-2 of dolomitic lime and trace elements applied the first 3 months after planting). Two pits were sampled between May and June 2015, in the same block, one in the ‘exclusion' plot (W-) and the other pit in the ‘exclusion-free' plot (W+). W- plots were equipped with two 40-cm wide plastic sheets in each inter-row to exclude 37% of the throughfall. The sampled trees were 5-year-old with a mean tree height of 20-m and root front depth down to 17-m depth. A 1.5-m wide square pit was dug in the 3-m wide inter-row of both the exclusion (W-) and control (W+) plots. Fine roots (< 2 mm) and ECM root tips were manually and very carefully collected from the soil, layer per layer, during pit digging in order to prevent any contamination between two consecutive soil depths and to collect the maximum biomass of fine roots in each soil layer. Ten soil layers were sampled from 0 to 400 cm depth (at 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-250, 250-300, 300-350, and 350-400 cm). Fine roots and ECM root tips were washed with tap water and stored at -20°C until analyses. Before performing molecular analyses, all the samples were ground with liquid nitrogen.DNA was extracted from 80 mg of fine roots or ECM root tips by using the FastDNA SPIN KIT (MP Biomedicals Santa Ana, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with some modifications. Briefly, samples were homogenized in 800 µl of CLS-VF buffer and 200 µl of PPS with a vortex step during 10 min, followed by an incubation of 15 min at room temperature.The samples were centrifuged (14 000 g, 10 min), and a binding matrix volume equal to the volume of supernatant was added, and agitated during 5 min at room temperature. After a centrifugation (14 000g, 10 min), a guanidine step washing was added as described by Tournier (2015). The DNA Binding Matrix was resuspended in 500 µL of guanidine thiocyanate (5.5 M),transfered to a Spin Filter column and centrifugated at 14 000 g for 1 min. This step was repeated and followed by two washing steps with SEWS-M. Finally, the DNA was eluted in 100 µl of DES. For all samples, extractions were made in triplicate and stored at -20°C before further analyses.The Internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 of the nuclear ribosomal RNA were amplified using the primers ITS1FI2 (5'-GAACCWGCGGARGGATCA-3') and ITS2 (5'-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3') for the ITS1 region (Schmidt et al., 2013) and the primers ITS86F (5'-GTGAATCATCGAATCTTTGAA-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') for the ITS2 region (De Beeck et al., 2014). The forward and reverse primers were modified prior to amplification by adding the adaptor sequences 5'-CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3' and 5'-GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-3', respectively, which are needed for the multiplexing of PCR products before sequencing. The amplification reaction was performed in a final volume of 25 µl with the modified primers (0.6 µM each), 2 µl of DNA extract, 200 µM of each dNTP, 200 ng/ml BSA, GoTaq® DNA Polymerase (2 units) and 1X Green GoTaq® Reaction Buffer (Promega, Charbonnieres, France), with the following cycling conditions: 94°C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 52°C (ITS1 region) or 55°C (ITS2 region) for 45 s, 72°C for 45 s; a final elongation step at 72°C for 10 min. To increase richness recovery and to limit PCR bias, three PCR replicates per sample were pooled, evaporated using a vacuum concentrator and resuspended in 50 µl of sterile water. All amplicon products were subjected to paired-end Illumina MiSeq sequencing (2×250 bp) by Get-PlaGe (Genotoul, Castanet-Tolosan, France) as follows, single multiplexing was performed using home-made 6 bp index, which were added to reverse primers during a second PCR with 12 cycles, using the forward primer (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGAC) and reverse primer (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-index-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGA-CGTGT).The resulting PCR products were purified and loaded onto the Illumina MiSeq cartridge according to the manufacturer instructions. The quality of the run was checked internally using PhiX (20%), and then each pair-end sequences were assigned to its sample with the help of the previously integrated index. Illumina sequencing, base calling and demultiplexing were carried out using RTA v1.18.54, MCS 2.6 and bcl2fastq2.17.",

To accomplish this, we used a combination of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing and hybrid metagenome assembly and binning approach to systematically explore the population and strain level diversity of nitrifiers in three full-scale nitrogen removal systems with different process configurations. In doing so, we also aimed to assess factors that may influence the population and intra-population diversity of co-existing nitrifiers.",

    "description": "Staphylococcus aureus is gram-positive bacterial pathogen capable of asymptomatically colonizing about a third of the world population. This pathogen is the most common cause of nosocomial infections and a leading cause of death in hospitalized patients. The ability of S. aureus to colonize several environments is due to the presence of a variety of virulence factors that facilitate attachment, colonization, cell-cell interactions, tissue damage, dissemination through the body, and immune evasion. S. aureus infection is a frequent problem encountered by patients with Atopic Dermatitis (AD), with bacterial colonization observed on both lesional and nonlesional skin. AD, commonly known as eczema, is a complex disease. Its progression and severity depend on genetic risk factors (e.g. loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin), altered microbiota, and exposure to allergens. Another important factor, often neglected, is the effect of skin colonization by different strains of S. aureus, with distinct metabolic capability and pathogenicity. Although various S. aureus genomes are currently available in public repositories, the lack of information about the original source of isolation (AD skin, respiratory tract), patient clinical data, and the difficulty into obtaining available bacterial isolates, complicates strain characterization and AD contextualization. However, to accurately understand how interactions are established with the host and other bacteria and to develop targeted interventions, it is crucial to discriminate between different strains. We propose a comprehensive study to better characterize S. aureus strains from healthy people and patients with atopic dermatitis.",

With over 400 million cases reported globally since 2019 and continued emergence of new variants, COVID-19 is now reported as a pandemic. Traditionally, testing for COVID-19 is done by detecting SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected from nasal swabs and/or saliva. However, SARS-CoV-2 can also be detected in feces of infected individuals. Wastewater samples can be used to test all individuals of a community contributing to the sewage collection system. Here, we profile community wastewater collected from a sewage collection system, detect presence of SARS-CoV-2, determine variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are present, and perform COVID-19 risk assessment of the study area. Using metagenomics analysis, we also detect other microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protists, and viruses) present in the samples. Results show that by analyzing all microorganisms present in wastewater, pathogens circulating in a community can provide an early warning for contagious diseases.",

    "description": "The “built environment” of a modern household is colonized by many different bacteria, entering the household through humans, animals, plants, and foods. Kitchen sponges are particularly well known to harbor a high number and diversity of bacteria, including pathogens. Viruses, archaea, and eukaryotes in kitchen sponges, however, have not been examined in detail so far. In order to increase knowledge on the non-bacterial kitchen sponge microbiota and its potential hygienic rel-evance, we investigated five used kitchen sponges by means of metagenomic shot-gun sequenc-ing. Viral particles were slightly enriched by a filter step during DNA extraction from the sponges. Data analysis revealed that ~2% of the sequences could be assigned to non-bacterial taxa. Each sponge harbored an individual, dominant virus species, while the present archaea were predom-inantly affiliated with halophilic taxa. Among the eukaryotic taxa, besides more harmless algae, or amoebas, also DNA affiliated with a parasitic roundworm was found. The presented work offers new insights into the complex microbiota of used kitchen sponges and will help to better evaluate their hygienic relevance.",

The present study investigated whether the inhibitory effect of this strain at very low numbers can be reproduced in vivo, i.e. on chilled vacuum packaged beef. C. maltaromaticum A5 up to 2 log CFU per cm2 was spiked onto beef steaks. The steaks were vacuum packaged and stored at 2oC for up to 12 weeks. The dynamics of the microbiota were determined by both conventional plating and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing methods. The predominant bacterial species at the end of storage were determined using both whole metagenome sequencing and whole genome sequencing.",

    "description": "The anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge is generally performed under mesophilic (30 – 40 C) or thermophilic (50 – 70 °C) conditions which implies the use of a significant amount of energy input to maintain the performances of the digester. The operation of anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge at low temperatures (between 30 °C and 25 oC) would lead to a reduction of the amount of energy required to heat the bioreactor.   Nevertheless, it has also been reported that a decrease in temperature below 30 °C impairs the methane yield of mesophilic digesters, probably because the microbial community structure is affected. To evaluate the effect of temperature on microbial communities, the present study shows the results of the application of low temperature anaerobic digestion at full-scale.",

    "description": "Kitchen sponges massively absorb and spread microorganisms, leading to contamination of kitchen appliances, surfaces, and food. Microwaving as an effective and widespread technique can rapidly reduce the microbial load of kitchen sponges. However, long-term effects of such treatments are largely unknown. Notably, it has been speculated that regularly applied domestic cleaning and disinfection may select for microbial communities with a higher pathogenic poten-tial and/or malodorous properties. In this study, we distributed newly purchased polyurethane kitchen sponges to 20 participants, with the instruction to use them under normal household conditions for four weeks. Ten of the participants sanitized their sponges regularly by a stand-ardized microwaving protocol, while the remaining ten sponges remained untreated. Meta-genomic sequence data evaluation indicated that, in addition to bacteria, viruses, eukaryotes, and archaea were also part of the kitchen sponge microbiome. Comparisons of sanitized and un-treated kitchen sponges indicated a trend towards a reduced structural microbial diversity while functional diversity increased. Microwave sanitization appeared to alter composition and meta-bolic properties of the microbial communities. Follow-up studies will have to show whether these changes are more positive or negative in terms of domestic hygiene, human health, and well-being.",

    "description": "The oral microbiome has been connected with lung health and may be of significance in the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 tests provide the opportunity to leverage stored samples for assessing the oral microbiome. However, these collection kits have not been tested for their accuracy in measuring the oral microbiome. Saliva is highly enriched with human DNA and reducing it prior to shotgun sequencing may increase the depth of bacterial reads. We examined both the effect of saliva collection method and sequence processing on measurement of microbiome depth and diversity by 16S and shotgun metagenomics. We collected 56 samples from 22 subjects. Each subject provided saliva samples with and without preservative, and a subset provided a second set of samples the following day. 16S rRNA gene (V4) sequencing was performed on all samples, and shotgun metagenomics was performed on a subset of samples collected with preservative with and without human DNA depletion before sequencing. We observed that the beta diversity distances within subjects over time was smaller than between unrelated subjects, and distances within subjects were smaller in samples collected with preservative. Samples collected with preservative had higher alpha diversity measuring both richness and evenness. Human DNA depletion before extraction and shotgun sequencing yielded higher total and relative reads mapping to bacterial sequences. We conclude that collecting saliva with preservative may provide more consistent measures of the oral microbiome and depleting human DNA increases yield of bacterial sequences.",

    "description": "Accurate monitoring of orally-faecally transmitted, gastro-enteric diseases in a population poses a challenge in public health management. Sewage represents a larger population, is freely obtainable and non-subject to approval. In addition, metagenomic sequencing offers simultaneous, multiple-target analysis. However, no study has ever demonstrated the sensitivity of metagenomics applied in this fashion before, in terms of number of ill persons.In this study, we spot-released 1013 colony-forming units (CFU) of Staphyloccus hyicus (S. hyicus, non-pathogenetic strain 842J-88) and 1014 CFU of Thalassobacillus hwangdonensis (T. hwangdonensis). The analytes were flushed down a toilet into the sewer in the catchment area of a public wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), serving a population of 36,000 people. Raw sewage was continuously sampled at the WWTPs inlet over 30- and 60-minute intervals and a total period of eight hours. The experiment was conducted twice with one week in-between release days and under comparable weather conditions.For the metagenomics analyses, a pure single isolate of S. hyicus was grown, sequenced, assembled and added to a large database of reference sequences. The sewage samples were mapped against the reference database. S. hyicus was identified on both release days. The overall mean sensitivity was 52 diarrhoeic persons, computed as simultaneously shedding 200 g of faeces at 106 CFU of analyte. That equalled 0.15 percent of the population of the WWTPs catchment area. No T. hwangdonensis was detected in any of the samples. We successfully demonstrated a repeatable release of a bacterial agent into the sewage system, retrieving and detecting it in a quantitative fashion. Sewage may be used to monitor the transmission of some faecally shed bacteria in a population. However, our results also show that suitability and sensitivity may have to be assessed a new for every analyte and experimental setup.",

    "description": "In this work an integrated study was carried out, showing the ability of two bacterial consortia, pre-enriched in two culture media (LB and PG), to degrade pure textile wastewater, without pretreatment and without the addition of nutritional sources. The best results in terms of percentage of decolorization, reduction of COD and decrease of toxicity were achieved with the consortium obtained from the LB medium pre-enrichment compared to the GP medium. These results highlight the importance of the selection of the appropriate culture media to optimize the degradation efficiency. Use of native consortia is a promising tool since they are adapted to the adverse conditions of wastewater discharge sites, and because they have a synergistic and complementary behavior compared to pure cultures that makes microbial communities more efficient for the degradation of pollutants such as azo-dyes.",

    "description": "Alopecia Areata (AA) is a highly prevalent autoimmune disease leading to hair loss in affected individuals. Associations between changes in the microbiome composition and AA have been previously reported, however, an in-depth characterization of gut microbiota requirement for the development of AA is lacking. To investigate the functional relevance of gut microbiota to AA development in vivo, we depleted the microbiome in the C3H/HeJ mouse model of AA. We found that antibiotic treatment protected mice from AA induction and led to decreased numbers of CD8+ T cells and an increase in the Treg/CD8+ ratio in the gut and skin-associated lymph nodes. To establish the relevance to the human situation, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and compared gut microbiome composition in stool samples between 34 AA patients and 12 healthy controls (HCs). We discovered a striking gut dysbiosis in AA patients compared with HCs, and in combination with shotgun metagenomics analysis performed in 30 cases and 20 controls, we identified members of the Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidaceae families such as Eubacterium eligens, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus, and Bacteroides caccae to characterize the gut dysbiosis in AA. Taken together with recent reports of reversal of AA in patients following fecal microbiota transplant, these data suggest that the gut microbiome may contribute to the pathogenesis of AA and offer new important implications for the treatment of this disease.",

    "description": "Biofiltration processes can be applied for the removal of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) both in wastewater and drinking water treatment systems. However, the TOrCs biotransformation mechanisms as well as the underlying drivers behind the transformation processes still remain elusive.In this study, we used laboratory batch incubations to investigate the biotransformation of 51 TOrCs by eight filter materials treating a range of water, from wastewater effluents to drinking water. Chemical analysis was complemented by 16S rRNA and metagenome sequencing for assessing associations between the biotransformation rate constants (kbiol), microbial composition and identified functional enzymes.We observed strong differences in the global transformation of TOrCs between the individual sand filters (0-58%) that were mirrored in microbial community composition, enzyme abundances and involved biotransformation pathways. The biotransformation potential, however, when factoring in biomass as ATP, which was strongly correlated with the kbiol, the differences in the transformation rates became negligible, but still clustered into high biomass filters and low biomass filters. When comparing these two groups, Nitrospira was abundant in the high biomass filters (> 39.0%) but correlated with none of the TOrCs.  Hydrogenophaga showed the broadest correlation with TOrCs biotransformation despite of its minor proportion (0.04%), and it also had the most complete xenobiotics degradation pathways, rendering it as a potential biotransformation indicator genus. Moreover, the enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene may be a promising genetic marker for biotransformations. The drinking water filters showed a distinct microbial community with Pseudomonas being dominant, correlating negatively with the kbiol, pointing to the slow biotransformation of TOrCs under oligotrophic condition.In general, this study provides new insights into so far rarely addressed associations between TOrCs biotransformation, microbial composition and functional potential which will be used to suggest novel biological indicators for assessing the removal performance of TOrCs in biofiltration systems. Moreover, it highlights the role of ATP in predicting the global transformation of TOrCs in sand filter systems.",

    "description": "We mapped the dsDNA virus assemblage in groundwater below sub-Saharan urban poor settlements in Arusha (Tanzania), Dodowa (Ghana) and Kampala (Uganda). Our results indicated that about 80% of dsDNA virus sequences matched the order of Caudovirales, i.e. indigenous bacteriophages. 1.8% of the dsDNA virus sequences matched those of viral pathogens that infect humans and larger animals, which we defined as so-called Above-Ground Hosts (AGH). Within this group, the relative abundances of the genera Chordopoxvirinae, Alphaherpesvirinae and Betairidovirinae were highest. Culturable E. coli bacteria were found, even in deeper wells, indicating that all water was faecally contaminated. The community assemblages sampled in the cities were statistically significantly different from each other. Dissolved ions, population density and sanitary status had no significant influence, but pH and latitude did.  We concluded that the transport of dsDNA virus in groundwater was location specific, but was not determined by input concentrations (i.e. related to population density) or related to groundwater chemistry. We hypothesize that other parameters, like the presence of macro-pores, cause these variations in these shallow, highly populated, heavily polluted terrestrial groundwater systems. About 34% of Africa has similar hydrogeology, so this may affect many urban areas continent-wide.",

Quantification of primary bioaerosol particles (whole cells) showed concentrations of > 106 cells/L. Imaged cells from fluorescent and scanning electron microscopy included microeukaryotes. Analytic chemistry detected Na+ and Cl- ions, which was in agreement with back-trajectories of an oceanic origin.

The 16 samples deposited here are 8 mock community samples (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard II (Log Distribution)) and 8 airfilter samples from two poultry houses from the same farm. Four of the mock community samples were spiked with the C. jejuni isolate CCUG11284T and four of the poultry farm samples were spiked with C. jejuni 927.

Fluoride-containing dentifrices have been extensively studied in relation to enamel resistance to demineralization, but its effect on the oral microbiota is less understood. Arginine has also been proposed as a promising prebiotic to promote pH buffering through ammonia production. Here, we present the first metagenomic (DNA sequencing of the whole microbial community) and metatranscriptomic (RNAseq of the same community) analyses of human dental plaque that evaluate the effect of a fluoride and a Fl+Arg dentifrices on oral microbial composition and activity. Fifty-three patients were enrolled in a clinical intervention study, including 26 caries-active and 27 caries-free adults. After a minimum 1-week washout period, dental plaque samples were collected at this post-washout baseline, 3 months after the use of a 1,450 ppm fluoride dentifrice and after 6 months of using a 1,450 ppm fluoride with 1.5% arginine dentifrice.",

The reversibility of the observed changes was assessed by changing the composition of the wastewater from complex monomeric back to simple. The introduction of fermentable compounds in the influent changed dramatically the bacterial community but left the settling properties and nutrient removal performance unchanged, whereas the introduction of polymeric compounds induced small changes in the bacterial community but altered the settling properties and denitrification efficiency. The changes induced by the wastewater transition were only partly reversed. Seven distinct stables states of the bacterial community were detected during the 921 days of experiment, four of them observed with the complex monomeric wastewater. The transitions between these states were not only causes by wastewater changes but also by operation failures and other incidences. However, the nutrient removal performance and settling properties of the AGS were globally maintained due to the functional redundancy of its bacterial community.",

    "description": "Plasmids can provide a selective advantage for microorganisms to survive and adapt to new environmental conditions. Plasmid-encoded traits, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) or virulence, impact on the ecology and evolution of bacteria and can significantly influence the burden of infectious diseases. Insight about the identity and functions encoded on plasmids on the global scale are largely lacking. Here we investigate the plasmidome of 24 samples (22 countries, 5 continents) from the global sewage surveillance project. We obtained 105 Gbp Oxford Nanopore and 167 Gbp Illumina DNA sequences from plasmid DNA preparations and assembled 165,302 contigs (159,322 circular). Of these, 58,429 encoded for genes with plasmid-related and 11,222 with virus/phage-related proteins. About 90% of the circular DNA elements did not have any similarity to known plasmids. Those that exhibited similarity, had similarity to plasmids whose hosts were previously detected in these sewage samples (e.g. Acinetobacter, Escherichia, Moraxella, Enterobacter, Bacteroides, and Klebsiella). Some AMR classes were detected at a higher abundance in plasmidomes (e.g. macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B, macrolide, and quinolone), as compared to the respective whole complex sewage samples. In addition to AMR genes, a range of functions were encoded on the candidate plasmids, including plasmid replication and maintenance, mobilization, and conjugation. In summary, we describe a laboratory and bioinformatics workflow for the recovery of plasmids and other potential extrachromosomal DNA elements from complex microbiomes, and data that could provide valuable insight into the ecology and evolution of microbiomes, knowledge about AMR transmission, and discovery of novel functions.",

    "description": "Mitigation of N2O-emissions from soils is needed to reduce climate forcing by food production. Inoculating soils with N2O-reducing bacteria would be effective, but costly and impractical as a standalone operation. Here we demonstrate that digestates obtained after biogas production may provide a low-cost and widely applicable solution. Firstly, we show that indigenous N2O-reducing bacteria in digestates grow to high levels during anaerobic enrichment under N2O. Gas kinetics and meta-omic analysis show that the N2O respiring organisms, recovered as metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) grow by harvesting fermentation intermediates of the methanogenic consortium. Three digestate-derived denitrifying bacteria were obtained through isolation, one of which matched the recovered MAG of a dominant Dechloromonas-affiliated N2O reducer. While the identified N2O-reducers encoded genes required for a full denitrification pathway and could thus both produce and sequester N2O, their regulatory traits predicted that they act as N2O-sinks in the current system . Secondly, moving towards practical application, we show that these isolates grow by aerobic respiration in digestates, and that fertilization with these enriched digestates reduces N2O emissions. This shows that the ongoing implementation of biogas production in agriculture opens a new avenue for cheap and effective reduction of N2O emissions from food production.",

In most studies, the workflow of conducting a microbiome study involves collecting and stabilizing a sample until it can be processed in a laboratory so that the community experiences little to no change until analysis. One widely used method is freezing at -20C or -80C. However, in scenarios were freezing is not a viable option, an alternative preservation method must used, but the effectiveness of commonly used preservatives is not well understood. To better understand the effects of different storage preservatives and storage conditions on the microbial community of fecal samples, we exposed human and canine fecal samples to a variety of commonly used preservation methods including freezing, using ethanol, RNALater, Omni-gene gut, and FTA cards, and a range of temperature conditions.",

Moreover urinary microbes, especially in ageing populations, are associated with morbidity even when infection is subsequently not proven. We present the first large-scale study to explore factors defining urinary microbiome composition in community-dwelling older adult women without any clinically active infection. Using 1600 twins, we estimate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to variation in microbiome using both 16S and shotgun metagenomics. We found that the urinary microbiome is distinct from nearby sites and is unrelated to stool microbiome.  Core urinary microbiome taxa were defined. The first component of weighted unifrac was heritable (18%) as were key taxa  (e.g Escherichia-Shigella (A>0.15)). Age, menopausal status, prior UTI and host genetics were top among factors defining the urobiome. Increased composition was associated with older age, contrary to findings in most other body sites.",

    "description": "This study developed a single-stage partial nitrification, anammox and denitratation (SPNADA) intergrated bioprocess for the treatment of low C/N ratio wastewater in an air-lift internal circulation reactor (AIR). During the 245 operated days, the reactor showed a high total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of 93.2% under limiting dissolved oxygen concentration of 0.5~1.0 mg/L. Reads-based metatranscriptomic analysis found that the expression of the amoA and hao genes for partial nitrification were as high as 3053.4 and 1394.6 RPM, respectively. In addition, the expression of hzsA and hdh genes for anammox were as high as 2706.5 RPM and 4290.6 RPM, respectively. Another notable trend in reads occurrence was that the expression of napA and narG gene for denitratation, were 78.7 and 321.8 PRM, and the sum of which was 3-fold higher than that of nirK and nirS genes. The genome-based analysis revealed that Nitrosomonas and Candidatus Brocadia with 5.5% and 10.0% relative expression were the dominant genera of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and anammox bacteria, respectively. Besides, the narG expression of Thiolinea (relative expression of 8.5%) that contained the only narG and no nirK or nirS gene accounted for 84.12% of the total narG expression. These results indicate Thiolinea was a potential denitratation bacteria, which played a major role in denitratation. Stoichiometric and kinetic evaluations confirmed that anammox as the dominant nitrogen removal pathway, accounting for 67.0% of the TN removed. Moreover, in terms of nitrite production, the contribution ratio of denitratation was 17.3%. Overall, these findings indicated the SPNADA process was successfully invented in an AIR, which provides a new perspective for nitrogen removal in low C/N ratio wastewater treatment.",

    "description": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States with an estimated incidence of 300,000 infections annually. Antibiotic intervention cures Lyme disease in the majority of cases; however, 10-20% of patients develop post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), a debilitating condition characterized by chronic fatigue, pain, and cognitive difficulties. The underlying mechanism responsible for PTLDS symptoms, as well as a reliable diagnostic tool, has remained elusive. We reasoned that the gut microbiome may play an important role in PTLDS given that the symptoms overlap considerably with conditions in which a dysbiotic microbiome has been observed, including mood, cognition, and autoimmune disorders. Analysis of sequencing data from a rigorously curated cohort of PTLDS patients revealed a gut microbiome signature distinct from healthy control subjects, as well as from ICU patients being treated with antibiotics. Notably, microbiome sequencing data alone was indicative of PTLDS which presents a potential, novel diagnostic tool for PTLDS.",

    "description": "Haemaphysalis longicornis, the Asian longhorned tick, is an invasive tick species that has spread rapidly across the northeastern and southeastern regions of the United States in recent years. This invasive pest species, known to transmit several tick-borne pathogens in its native range, is a potential threat to wildlife, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. Questing larval (n = 25), nymph (n = 10), and adult (n = 123), along with host-derived adult (n = 25) H. longicornis ticks were collected from various locations on Staten Island, NY. The pathobiome of each specimen was examined using two different high throughput sequencing approaches, virus enrichment and shotgun metagenomics. An average of 45,828,061 total reads per sample were recovered from the virus enriched samples and an average of 11,381,144 total reads per sample were obtained using shotgun metagenomics. Aside from endogenous viral sequences, no viruses were identified through either approach. Through shotgun metagenomics, Coxiella-like bacteria, Legionella, Sphingomonas, and other bacterial species were recovered. The Coxiella-like agent was ubiquitous and present at high abundances in all samples, suggesting it may be an endosymbiont. The other bacterial agents are not known to be transmitted by ticks. From these analyses, H. longicornis do not appear to host any endemic human tick-borne pathogens in the New York City region.",

    "title": "Defining culture conditions for Nitrolancea-a hidden nitrite-oxidizing bacterium",
    "description": "Nitrification is a key process for N-removal in engineered and natural environments, but recent findings of novel nitrifying microorganisms with surprising features revealed that our knowledge of this functional guild is still incomplete. Especially nitrite oxidation – the second step of nitrification – is catalyzed by a phylogenetically diverse bacterial group and only recently, bacteria of the phylum Chloroflexi have been identified as thermophilic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Among these, Nitrolancea hollandica was isolated from a laboratory-scale nitrifying bioreactor operated at 35°C with a high load of ammonium bicarbonate. However, very few closely related environmental 16S rRNA sequences have been retrieved so far and its distribution remains cryptic. In this study, we demonstrate how such thermophilic NOB can be enriched using modified mineral media inoculated with samples from a full-scale wastewater side-stream reactor operated at 39°C. Distinct cultivation conditions resulted in quick and reproducible high enrichment of two different genotypes of Nitrolancea, closely related to N. hollandica. The same cultivation approach was applied to a complex nitrite-oxidizing pre-enrichment at 42°C, which had been inoculated with biomass from the geothermal spring ‘Las Máquinas’ in the Copahue volcano area in Neuquen, Argentina. Here, an additional, distinct representative of the genus Nitrolancea was obtained. This novel species had 16S rRNA and nitrite oxidoreductase alpha subunit (nxrA) gene sequence identities to N. hollandica of 98.5% and 97.2%, respectively. A genomic average nucleotide identity between the Argentinian strain and N. hollandica of 91.9% indicates that it indeed is a distinct species.  All Nitrolancea cultures formed lancet-shaped cells identical to Nl. hollandica and revealed similar physiological features, including the capability to grow at high nitrite concentrations. Growth was optimal at temperatures of 35-37°C and was strongly enhanced by ammonium supplementation. Genomic comparisons revealed that the four Nitrolancea share a core set of 2114 genes and encode similar key functions. Our results define general growth preferences for Nitrolancea that enable their selective enrichment from artificial and natural environments. While these NOB might be of low abundance in nature, their proliferation is dependent on the balanced presence of nitrite and ammonium and an incubation temperature around 37°C.",

Wastewater (mixture of domestic, municipal and industrial) from the inlet of the activated sludge wastewater treatment plant was pumped into the six parallel hybrid filter systems each consisting of a vertical subsurface flow filter (VF) followed by a horizontal subsurface flow filter (HF). During the 35-day long experiment, AgNP and AgNO3 solutions each were dosed into two corresponding VF mesocosms influents (0.1 mg Ag/L in influent), while two parallel subsystems were used as controls. Water samples from influent and effluent of VF were collected on day 35 and filter material samples from VF and HF mesocosms were collected on day 0 and 35. Microbial community profiling was performed using shotgun metagenomics (Illumina NextSeq 500 system).",

A field of application thereof, is bioelectrochemical remediation, an effective strategy inenvironments where the absence of suitable electron acceptors limits classic bioremediationapproaches. Understanding the microbial community structure and genetic potential of anodebiofilms is of great interest to interpret the mechanisms occurring in BES. In this study, by using awhole metagenome sequencing approach, taxonomic and functional diversity patterns in theinoculum and on the anodes of three continuous-flow BES for the removal of phenol, toluene andBTEX were obtained. The genus Geobacter was highly enriched on the anodes and tworeconstructed genomes were taxonomically related to the Geobacteraceae family. To functionallycharacterize the microbial community, the genes coding for the anaerobic degradation of toluene,ethylbenzene and phenol were selected as genetic markers for the anaerobic degradation of thepollutants. The genes related with direct extracellular electron transfer (EET) were also analyzed.The inoculum carried the genetic baggage for the degradation of aromatics but lacked the capacityof EET, while anodic bacterial communities were able to pursuit both processes. Themetagenomic approach provided useful insights into the ecology and complex functions withinhydrocarbon degrading electrogenic biofilms.",

    "description": "Enterobacterales includes important human pathogens causing a wide spectrum of clinical disease. In healthcare settings, sinks and other wastewater sites have been shown to be reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant *E. coli* and *Klebsiella* spp., particularly in the context of outbreaks of resistant strains amongst patients. Without focusing exclusively on resistance markers or a clinical outbreak, we demonstrate that many hospital sink drains are abundantly and persistently colonised with diverse populations of *E. coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae* and *Klebsiella oxytoca*, including both antimicrobial-resistant and susceptible strains. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of cultured isolates, we show that environmental bacterial populations are largely structured by ward and sink, with only a handful of lineages, such as *E. coli* ST635, being widely distributed, suggesting different prevailing ecologies which may vary as a result of different inputs and selection pressures. Using metagenomics from 20 sink-timepoints, we show that sinks also harbour many clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes. Our study reinforces the potential role of sinks in contributing to Enterobacterales infection and antimicrobial resistance in hospital patients, something that could be amenable to intervention.",

    "description": "Oral microbiota is affected by multiple factors, including dietary, drinking, ethnicity, and smoking, while little is known about how the oral microbiome varies across healthy school children with different ethnic backgrounds living in the same geographic regions. Meanwhile the relationship between oral microbiota and gut microbiota also need further research, due to previous studies mainly focusing on a single body habitat. Here, we collected saliva and gut samples from 60 school children covering the Tibetan, Han and Hui ethnicities and living in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. The microbial composition of saliva and gut was sequenced by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. Bacteroidetes (41.19%) and Proteobacteria (24.83%) was the dominant phyla in the oral. 5 genera of oral microbiota showed significant differences in relative abundance. The alpha diversity (Shannon diversity) of saliva in Tibetan group was lowest than that in the Hui and Han groups, whereas the beta diversity of saliva was similar among the three groups. Based on the sample sites, saliva had higher alpha diversity than that in the gut among the three groups, but there was no association between the alpha diversity of oral and gut microbiota. In addition, Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) indicated that oral microbiota was completed separated from gut microbiota. The consumption of seafood, poultry meat, sweets, and vegetables was correlated with multiple oral microbiota. Some oral bacterial genera were also associated with gut microbial genera. Our results suggested that the diversity and composition of salivary microbiome had slight differences among the different ethnic groups. Meanwhile, dietary probably affected the salivary microbiome composition and the salivary microbiota might have an association with the gut microbiota.",

The integration of microbiological and biochemical as well as metagenome, metatranscriptome and metaproteome analyses should provide information about the occurrence of antibiotics, ARMs and actually expressed ARGs. The results of these investigations will be used to establish an antibiotic resistance rapid test.

Our aim was to compare the microbiome between treatment-naïve MS subjects early in their disease course and controls, and between Caucasian (CA), Hispanic (HA), and African American (AA) MS subjects. From fecal samples, we performed 16S rRNA V4 sequencing and analysis from 45 MS subjects (15 CA, 16 HA, 14 AA) and 44 matched healthy controls, and whole metagenomic shotgun sequencing from 24 MS subjects (all newly diagnosed, treatment naïve, and steroid-free) and 24 controls. In all three ethnic groups, there was an increased relative abundance of the same single genus, Clostridium, compared to ethnicity-matched controls.  Analysis of microbiota networks showed significantly different characteristics between the combined MS cohorts and controls, suggesting global differences not restricted to individual taxa.  Metagenomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of individual species within Clostridia as well as particular functional pathways in the MS subjects. The increased relative abundance of Clostridia in all three early MS cohorts compared to controls confirmed by metagenomic analyses provides candidate taxa for further study as biomarkers or agents in MS.",

    "description": "Human sewage may contain components of the microbiome of local population and this study aimed to optimize a method to identify human enteric viruses present using random primed next generation sequencing. To achieve this goal two methods using different enrichment steps were compared. Enrichment was based on the binding properties of viral capsid using pig-mucin capture, or by selecting viral RNA prior to library preparation using a capture array. A third method, non-specific biophysical precipitation with polyethylene glycol, was included for comparison.  All three methods gave full genomes of a number of common human enteric viruses including norovirus, rotavirus, husavirus, enterovirus or astrovirus. Many norovirus sequences were detected in all three sewage samples, with genogroup II being more prevalent. Surprisingly the pig-mucin capture increased not only recovery of norovirus and rotavirus but also of astrovirus, sapovirus and husavirus. Being able to document the virome of sewage will provide information for molecular epidemiology and will be useful in developing strategies to prevent further spread of viruses.",

    "description": "Seven strains of Pseudomonas spp. were isolated by its ability to use furfural as a sole carbon and energy source. Two of them were previously isolated from wastewater treatment facilities (Lee et al. 2016. Appl Biochem Biotechnol 178:76–90) and the remaining five were obtained by enrichment cultures of sludge samples from pulp mill wastewater. In order to elucidate the molecular basis of furfural biodegradation, we obtained the draft genome sequences of these strains. Briefly, genomic DNA from Pseudomonas spp. isolates named ALS1131, ALS1279, FFL24, FFL34, FF4, VN230, and VN231 were subjected to paired-end sequencing in a MiSeq platform with at least a 30X coverage. Then, several assemblers (including Spades, Megahit, IDBA-UD among others) were used for genome reconstruction and the best assemblies were subjected to reconciliation tools (such as Metassembler) along with an in-house guided-assembly strategy. The final assemblies were checked with QUAST and annotated with the DDBJ Fast Annotation Tool using the Cluster of Orthologous Groups approach. These genomes represent a novel genetic resource for improved tolerance and conversion of furan aldehydes suitable for biotechnological applications.",

Additionally, samples were collected every two days for three weeks post-treatment to determine if potential effects would be reversed. Fecal samples from pups born to mothers treated with methamphetamine or control mother treated with saline, were collected starting at an age of 21 days and continuing up until 41 days. Tissue samples from both mothers and offspring were collected at the end of the experiment which provides us the ability to correlate microbiome changes to neurological or immunological differences.

    "description": "Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as an emerging environmental pollutant, have received widespread attention. Among the different atmospheric environments including wastewater treatment plant (fine screens and sludge thickener), bathroom, laboratory, hospital and outdoor, the highest total concentration of ARGs is detected in the haze outdoor (9×105 copies/m3), while the lowest is in the bathroom atmosphere (4.2×104 copies/m3). Furthermore, β-lactam ARGs are found to be the dominant ARGs in these 6 atmospheric environments. Due to the large number and widespread use of antibiotics, the airborne ARGs in hospital have the highest diversity and equitability. The β-lactam ARGs are significantly positively correlated with sulfonamides ARGs, indicating the mechanism of co-resistance that is resistant to different resistance determinants on the same genetic elements. The network analysis provides potential host information between the airborne ARGs and the coexisted microbial taxa. Sphingomonas and Bradyhizoblum strains presumably host for tetracycline and β-lactam ARGs, respectively. Furthermore, the human body obtains the highest dose rate of ARGs through food intake (105 copies/d/kg), followed by drinking water (103 copies/d/kg), and finally the respiratory route (1-10 copies/d/kg). However, both the exposure dose of blaOXA-1 in any of the 6 atmospheric environments and that of blaTEM-1 in any of the 5 atmospheric environments are higher than the exposure dose of blaSHV (-0.62 copies/kg/d) and that of tetX (1.38 copies/kg/d) from water. Therefore, we should not ignore the exposure risk of ARGs in the atmospheric environment while paying attention to the exposure risk of ARGs in water and food.",

    "description": "Microalgal biomass is an alternative feedstock for biogas production although its C/N ratio is usually lower than optimal, therefore co-fermentation is recommended. Identification of key microbes and biochemical pathways is essential to make microalgal feedstock more sustainable and economically feasible. Biogas production from photoautotrophically grown Chlorella vulgaris (Ch. vulgaris) biomass (240 mL CH4 g oTS-1) and co-fermentation with maize silage (330 mL CH4 g oTS-1) has been studied in semi continuous laboratory biogas fermenters. Maize silage control yielded 310 mL CH4 g oTS-1. The microbial community and the read-based functional profiles, derived from these data, were examined during the process by using next-generation metagenome Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The read-based core microbiome consisted of 92 genera from which 60 abundant taxa were directly associated with the microbial methane producing food chain. The data-set was also analyzed in a genome-based approach. 65 bins were assembled, 52 of them belonged in the core biogas producing genera identified by the read-based metagenomes. The read-based and genome-based approaches complemented and verified each other. The functional profiles indicated a variety of glycoside hydrolases. Substantial rearrangements of the methanogen functions have also been observed. Co-fermentation of algal biomass and plant biomass can be carried out for an extended period of time without process failure. The microbial members of the inoculum are well conserved, feedstock composition cause relative abundance changes in the core microbiome.",

    "description": "Metagenomic sequencing has enabled detailed investigation of diverse microbial communities, but understanding their spatiotemporal variability remains an important challenge. Here we present DIVERS, a widely applicable method based on replicate sampling and spike-in sequencing. The method rigorously quantifies the contributions of temporal dynamics, spatial sampling variability, and technical noise to the variances and covariances of absolute bacterial abundances. We applied DIVERS to investigate a high-resolution time series of the human gut microbiome and a spatial survey of a soil bacterial community in Manhattan’s Central Park. Our analysis showed that in the gut, technical noise dominated the abundance variability for nearly half of the detected taxa. DIVERS also revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity of gut microbiota, and high temporal covariances of taxa within the Bacteroidetes phylum. In the soil community, spatial variability primarily contributed to abundance variance at short time scales (weeks), while temporal variability dominated at longer time scales (several months).",

    "description": "Milk and cheese are microbial ecosystems that can harbor diverse bacterial communities and therefore are vulnerable to spoilage and other defects. Cheese defects constitute a considerable burden to the dairy industry, among which slits are one of the most common concerns for Cheddar cheese. To advance the goal of producing cheese free of slit defects, we employed high-throughput DNA sequencing targeting 16S rRNA genes to understand how bacterial communities of raw and pasteurized milk affect the cheese quality. Included in our DNA sequencing approach is the capacity to distinguish between living and total bacteria by the application of propidium monoazide (PMA). Examination of Cheddar cheese samples showed a steady decline in alpha diversity of non-starter bacteria during the 120-day aging period. Compositional changes were also observed such that Streptococcus and Pseudomonas proportions decreased and Lactobacillus and Bacillus increased towards the end of aging. Comparisons between matched milk and cheese samples indicated cheese defects could be associated with the bacterial communities in pasteurized milk. Cheese that contained slits was made from milk harboring fewer contaminating bacterial cells but a larger number of species compared to milk that resulted in high-quality cheese. The presence of Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus and Turicibacter in pasteurized milk were also correlated with slits in cheese. The abundance of these genera were also highly dependent on equipment-cleaning schedules and their proportions decreased over 3-fold immediately after cleaning. Overall, our findings show that the slit defects might be due to a subpopulation of bacterial strains that survive milk pasteurization (HTST) in low abundance but persist and remain metabolically active during cheese fermentation. This work contributes to our understanding of bacterial population dynamics in dairy processing facilities and provides opportunities to modify cleaning and processing protocols to ensure the consistent production of high-quality dairy products.",

    "title": "Taxonomic and functional characterisation of the microbial community during spontaneous in vitro fermentation of Riesling must",
    "description": "Although there is an extensive tradition of research into the microbes that underlie the winemaking process, much remains to be learnt. We combined the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) tools of metabarcoding and metagenomics, to characterize how microbial communities of Riesling musts sampled at four different vineyards, and their subsequent spontaneously fermented derivatives, vary. We specifically explored community variation relating to three points: (i) how microbial communities vary by vineyard; (ii) how community biodiversity changes during alcoholic fermentation; and (iii) how microbial community varies between musts that successfully complete alcoholic fermentation and those that become ‘stuck’ in the process. Our metabarcoding data showed a general influence of microbial composition at the vineyard level. Two of the vineyards (4 and 5) had strikingly a change in the differential abundance of Metschnikowia. We therefore additionally performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on a subset of the samples to provide preliminary insights into the potential relevance of this observation, and used the data to both investigate functional potential and reconstruct draft genomes (bins). At these two vineyards, we also observed an increase in non-Saccharomycetaceae fungal functions, and a decrease in bacterial functions during the early fermentation stage. The binning results yielded 11 coherent bins, with both vineyards sharing the yeast bins Hanseniaspora and Saccharomyces. Read recruitment and functional analysis of this data revealed that during fermentation, a high abundance of Metschnikowia might serve as a biocontrol agent against bacteria, via a putative iron depletion pathway, and this in turn could help Saccharomyces dominate the fermentation. During alcoholic fermentation, we observed a general decrease in biodiversity in both the metabarcoding and metagenomic data. Unexpected Micrococcus behavior was observed in vineyard 4 according to metagenomic analyses based on reference-based read mapping. Analysis of open reading frames using these data showed an increase of functions assigned to class Actinobacteria in the end of fermentation. Therefore, we hypothesize that bacteria might sit-and-wait until Saccharomyces activity slows down. Complementary approaches to annotation instead of relying a single database provide more coherent information true species. Lastly, our metabarcoding data enabled us to identify a relationship between stuck fermentations and Starmerella abundance. Given that robust chemical analysis indicated that although the stuck samples contained residual glucose, all fructose had been consumed, we hypothesize that this was because fructophilic Starmerella, rather than Saccharomyces, dominated these fermentations. Overall, our results showcase the different ways in which metagenomic analyses can improve our understanding of the wine alcoholic fermentation process.",

    "description": "A comparison of the reactor performance and microbial communities of two anammox reactors operated under two distinct nitrogen loading rates, R1 - low loading rate (0.8 kgN•m-3•L-1) and R2 - high loading rate (10.5 kgN•m-3•L-1), was undertaken. While both reactors showed high NH4+-N removal efficiencies (>90%), the total nitrogen removal efficiency (<60%) was much lower in R1 due to relatively higher nitrate production. Metagenomic analysis found the reactors had significant differences in the number of reads derived from critical genes for the nitrogen cycling. In particular, the genes associated with anammox were significantly higher in R2. Another notable trend in read occurrence was the relatively higher levels of reads from nxr in R1, which encodes nitrite oxidoreductase. Assembly of the metagenome yielded 27 high quality bins and, as expected, the percentage of reads attributed to the anammox bins was much higher in R2, 43.0%, than in R1, 22.5%. Interestingly, the proportion of reads mapping to bins of obligate nitrite oxidizers were much higher in R1 than in R2. An additional subset of bins shown to contain nxr showed the same trend. Taken together these results indicate that the anammox reactor operated under lower nitrogen loading rate conditions had both a decrease in anammox organisms and an increase in nxr in the microbial community. The increase in nxr likely accounts for the relatively higher concentration of nitrate in the R1 effluent.",

    "description": "Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly serious threat to global public health, but less is known how microbial control in health care or cleanroom facilities modifies the in-house microbiota and its associated resistome. To understand these human interventions, we compared the microbiota present in abiotic surfaces of clinical settings and other built environments. State-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies as well as genome and plasmid reconstructions allowed us to determine that increased confinement and cleaning was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a shift from Gram-positive (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) to Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) bacteria as well as within genomes (Acinetobacter). Moreover, the microbiome of highly maintained built environments showed a completely different resistome and present a higher diversity of resistance genes than naturally unrestricted buildings. Our results highlight that the loss of microbial diversity correlates with an increase of resistances and indicate the need of implementing strategies to restore diversity to counteract propagation of resistances in the future.",

    "description": "Human viral pathogens are a major public health threat. Reliable information that accurately describes and characterizes the global occurrence and transmission of human viruses is essential to support national and global priority setting, public health actions, and treatment decisions. However, large areas of the globe are currently without surveillance due to limited health care infrastructure and lack of international cooperation. We propose a novel surveillance strategy, using metagenomic analysis of toilet material from international air flights as a method for worldwide viral disease surveillance. The aim of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a method for viral analysis of airplane toilet waste enabling simultaneous detection and quantification of a wide range of human viral pathogens. Toilet waste from 19 international airplanes was analyzed for viral content, using viral capture probes followed by high-throughput sequencing. Numerous human pathogens were detected including enteric and respiratory viruses. Several geographic trends were observed with samples originating from South Asia having significantly higher viral species richness as well as higher abundances of salivirus A, aichivirus A and enterovirus B, compared to samples originating from North Asia and North America. In addition, certain city specific trends were observed, including high numbers of rotaviruses in airplanes departing from Islamabad. Based on this study we believe that central sampling and analysis at international airports could be a useful supplement for global viral surveillance, valuable for outbreak detection and for guiding public health resources.",

    "description": "A great effort is being made by the international community to reduce air pollution but very little is known about the biological community (airbiota) present in the outdoor air. The study of the airbiota is relevant due to its potential role in dissemination of plant, animal and human diseases, with important implications in public health, and a huge economic impact on crops and stockbreeding productivity. Our current knowledge about airbiota is almost restricted to pollen and fungal spores, measured through microscopy techniques, and bacterial communities studies using culture-dependent analysis or amplicon-based approaches, while studies on viruses are almost inexistent. Therefore, a global overview of the airborne biological community is crucial to understand the dynamics of the air ecosystem, to identify marker organisms and to establish new air quality indicators. However, there is not a standardized method to capture the whole diversity present in the air. Therefore, the evaluation of different capturing methods is a key step to establish a standard framework.",

    "description": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can mediate the direct conversion of organic matter from wastewater into electricity using bacterial biofilms as biocatalysts. One of the critical points in MFCs is to understand which electroactive bacteria and which mechanisms are involved in the extracellular electron transfer to the anode. The goal of this study was to evaluate how an applied voltage between anode and cathode influences the anodic bacterial community structure and activity. Two MFCs were operated with an external resistance of 1000 ohms. One was submitted to an applied electrical voltage of 500 mV during the first four days of biofilm formation and the other was started without additional applied voltage. When the electricity production was stable, both total DNA and total protein were extracted and sequenced. The combined metaproteomic / metagenomic approach shows that when a voltage was applied during the colonization step, a direct electron transfer via cytochrome c was the major mechanism detected and mainly mediated by Geobacter sp. With the other MFC, a higher diversity of bacteria, such as Pseudomonas and Aeromonas, seemed to be involved in the electricity production using mediated electron transfer via flavin family members when no voltage was applied during the colonization step.",

    "description": "The increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria has raised global concern regarding the future effectiveness of antibiotics and the impact that resistance will have on human health. Human activities, which influence microbial communities and environmental resistomes, can inadvertently generate additional risks. In this work, we analyzed microbial communities and the resistome in samples collected at three city hospitals and three sites along the Bogotá River, a vital freshwater supply for the extended metropolitan area of Bogotá. Water parameters indicated an increase in contamination and the presence of antibiotics and other commonly used drugs as the river passed through the city. Community profiles done by 16S rRNA gene analysis and whole metagenome sequencing revealed diverse microbial communities that varied among sites and years sampled, but tended to separate river samples upstream of the city from more contaminated hospital and downstream river samples. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), identified in the metagenomes, were more abundant in the more contaminated water samples from hospitals and the sites downstream of the city. Clinically relevant antibiotic resistant pathogens were also recovered from these sites. We found evidence of mobile genetic elements localized next to ARGs in assembled metagenomic contigs, suggesting the possibility of mobilizing resistance markers in these aquatic microbial populations. This study shows that anthropic activities alter microbial communities and bring together microorganisms of varied origins where interactions can affect both abundance and the possible spread of ARGs in water ecosystems that are fundamental to human welfare.",

    "description": "The early-life intestinal microbiota plays a key role in shaping host immune system development. We found that a single early-life antibiotic course (1PAT) accelerated Type 1 diabetes (T1D) development in male NOD mice. The single course had strong and persistent effects on the intestinal microbiome, selecting for a highly metabolically active metagenome, with altered hepatic and serum metabolites. The exposure led to differential ileal and hepatic histone modification, and perturbed ileal gene expression, strongly affecting the normal maturational pattern. Earliest effects involved specific genes in innate immune pathways, with later effects on adaptive immunity. Microbiome analysis revealed four potential T1D-protective taxa and four T1D-accelerating taxa, and a network linking specific microbial taxa to differences in ileal gene expression was identified. This simplified animal model has improved understanding of the mechanisms by which early-life gut microbiome perturbations alter host intestinal responses, contributing to T1D.",

    "description": "Hong Kong has the world's largest scale application of Chemical Enhanced Primary Treatment process. The CEPT sludge was collected from local treatment facility. Ultrasonic treatment was applied to enhance the hydrolysis of the CEPT sludge before anaerobic digestion. In order to investigate the effect of ultrasonic treatment on the digestibility of CEPT sludge and corresponding microbial community, anaerobic digestion of ultrasound-treated CEPT sludge was carried out in lab-scale sequential batch reactors. Metatranscriptomes and metagenomes were constructed for the community in the batch reactor at three independent cycles.",

    "title": "multiple antibiotic resistance coliform bacteria was isolated from influent of Shatin WWTP treating domestic wastewater in Hong Kong. 96 randomly picked coliform colonies were pooled together for resistome quantification based on Illumina and Nanopore sequencing platforms",
    "description": "Wastewater treatment plants functioned as the intersection between the human society and the nature environment, are receiving increasingly more attention on risk assessment of the acquisition of environmental antibiotic resistancet genes (ARGs) by pathogenetic populations during treatment. However, because of the general lack of robust resistome profiling methods, genotype and resistance phenotype is still poorly correlated in human pathogens of sewage samples. Here we applied MinION nNanopore sequencing to quantify the resistancet genes of multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) coliform bacteria, a common indicator for human enteric pathogens in sewage samples. Our pipeline could deliver the results within 30 hours from sample collection and the resistome quantification was consistent to that based on the Illumina platform. Additionally, the long Nanopore reads not only enabled a simultaneous identification of the carrier populations of ARGs detected, but also facilitated the genome reconstruction of a representative MAR strain, from which we identified an instance of chromosomal integration of environmental resistance gene obtained by plasmid exchange with a porcine pathogen. This study demonstrated the utilization of MinION sequencing in real-time monitoring and simultaneous phylogenetic tracking of environmental ARGs to address potential health risk associated with them.",

    "title": "Stationary and portable sequencing approaches for tracking fecal contamination in an urban stormwater system",
    "description": "Urban sewer systems consist of wastewater and stormwater sewers, of which typically onlythe wastewater is processed before being discharged. Occasionally, misconnections ordamages in the network occur, resulting in wastewater entering the stormwater system andbeing discharged without prior processing. Cultivation of faecal indicator bacteria, such asEscherichia coli (E. coli), is the current standard for tracing wastewater contamination. Thismethod is cheap but cannot be employed in the field and is characterised by its limitedspecificity. Here, we compared the E. coli culturing approach with two different DNAsequencing-based methodologies (i.e., 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on the IlluminaMiSeq platform and shotgun metagenomic sequencing on an Oxford Nanopore MinIOndevice), analysing 73 stormwater samples collected throughout the Stockholm city areas.High correlations were obtained between E. coli culturing counts and frequencies of humangut microbiome sequencing reads (via amplicon sequencing), indicating that E. coli is indeeda good indicator of faecal contamination. In contrast to E.coli culturing, amplicon sequencingcould, however, further distinguish between two different sources of contamination in anarea, where misconnections in the stormwater system were later on detected. Shotgunmetagenomic sequencing on a subset of the samples using the portable Oxford NanoporeMinION real-time sequencing device correlated well with the amplicon sequencing data. Insummary, this study shows that DNA sequencing allows distinguishing differentcontamination sources in stormwater systems and demonstrates the potential of using aportable sequencing device in the field for tracking faecal contamination.",

    "description": "The human intestinal microbiota is a homeostatic ecosystem with a remarkable impact on human health and the disruption of this equilibrium leads to an increased susceptibility to infection by numerous pathogens. In this study, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and two different bioinformatics approaches, to investigate possible changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in samples from patients with STEC infection compared to healthy and healed controls, collected during an outbreak caused by a STEC O26:H11 infection. Regardless of the bioinformatic procedure used, a good resolution of the taxonomic profiles of the samples was achieved. The faeces collected from the STEC infected patients showed a lower intestinal abundance of the beneficial microorganisms Bifidobacterium and Clostridiales spp. in comparison to controls where those microorganisms predominated. These differences were observed with both bioinformatic approaches used and seemed to be related with the STEC infection although the variation in the relative abundance of the members of the Bifidobacterium genus could have also been associated with the dysbiotic status following the diarrhoea.Finally, the metagenomic sequencing allowed to identify in the STEC positive samples, all the virulence traits present in the genomes of the STEC O26 that caused the outbreak. The results shown represent a first evidence of the changes occurring in the intestinal microbiota of children in the course of STEC infection and indicate that metagenomics may be a promising tool for the culture-independent clinical diagnosis of the infection.",

    "description": "Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities provides in-depth knowledge of the microbiome by cataloging bacterial, fungal, and viral gene content within a sample, providing an advantage over amplicon sequencing approaches that assess taxonomy but not function, and are taxonomically limited. However, mammalian DNA can dominate host-derived samples, obscuring changes in microbial populations because few DNA sequence reads are from the microbial component. We developed and optimized a novel method for enriching microbial DNA from human oral samples, and compared its efficiency and potential taxonomic bias with commercially available kits. Three commercially available host depletion kits were directly compared with size filtration and a novel method involving osmotic lysis and treatment with propidium monoazide (lyPMA) in human saliva samples. We evaluated the percentage of shotgun metagenomic sequencing reads aligning to the human genome, and taxonomic biases, compared to untreated samples. lyPMA was the most efficient method of removing host-derived sequencing reads compared to untreated sample (8.53 ± 0.10% vs 89.29 ± 0.03%). Furthermore, lyPMA treated samples exhibit the lowest taxonomic bias compared to untreated samples. Osmotic lysis followed by PMA treatment is a cost-effective, rapid and robust method for enriching microbial sequence data in shotgun metagenomics from fresh and frozen saliva samples, and may be extensible to other biomaterials.",

    "description": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis induce sustained clinical responses in a sizeable minority of cancer patients. Here, we show that primary resistance to ICI can be due to an abnormal gut microbiota. Antibiotics (ATB) inhibited the clinical benefit of ICI in advanced cancer patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from cancer patients who responded to ICI (but not from non-responding patients) into germ-free or ATB-treated mice ameliorated the antitumor effects of PD-1 blockade. Metagenomics of patient stools at diagnosis revealed correlations between clinical responses to ICI and the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila. Oral supplementation with A. muciniphila post-FMT with non-responder feces restored the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in an IL-12-dependent manner, by increasing the recruitment of CCR9+CXCR3+CD4+ T lymphocytes into tumor beds.",

    "title": "Anaerobic Treatment of Antibiotic Production Wastewater Pretreated with Enhanced Hydrolysis: Simultaneous Reduction of COD and ARGs",
    "description": "The presence of high concentration antibiotics in wastewater can disturb the stability of biological wastewater treatment systems and promote generation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during the treatment. To solve this problem, a pilot system consisting of enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment and an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor in succession was constructed for treating oxytetracycline production wastewater, and the performance was evaluated in a pharmaceutical factory in comparison with a full-scale anaerobic system operated in parallel. After enhanced hydrolysis under conditions of pH 7 and 85 oC for 6 h, oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 11,086 ± 602 mg L-1 was directly introduced into the pilot UASB reactor. With the effective removal of oxytetracycline and its antibacterial activity (from 874 and 900 mg L-1 to less than 0.61 and 0.84 mg L-1, respectively) by the enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment, a COD removal between 68.9 % and 83.2 % was achieved at an organic loading rate ranging from 3.3 to 5.9 kg m-3 d-1. At the same time, the relative abundances of the total tet genes and a mobile element (Class 1 integron) in anaerobic sludge on Day 96 were one order of magnitude lower than those inoculated on Day 0 (P< 0.01). The reduction of ARGs was further demonstrated by metagenomic sequencing. By comparison, the full-scale anaerobic system treating oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent COD of 3,720 ± 128 mg L-1 after dilution exhibited a COD removal of 51 ± 4 % at an OLR 1.2 ± 0.2 kg m-3 d-1, and a total tet gene abundance in sludge was five times higher than the pilot-scale system (P< 0.01). The above result demonstrated that enhanced hydrolysis as a pretreatment method could enable efficient anaerobic treatment of oxytetracycline production wastewater containing high concentrations of oxytetracycline with significantly lower generation of ARGs.",

    "description": "One of the most prominent examples of obligate symbiosis is the relationship between aphids and their bacterial endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola (Gammaproteobacteria). Almost all aphids host the anciently acquired symbiont Buchnera, but we find that Geopemphigus species have lost Buchnera and rather contain a maternally transmitted bacterial symbiont from the phylum Bacteroidetes. In this study we characterize this new bacterial endosymbiont by sequencing the complete genome of the novel symbiont and show that the symbiont has lost many ancestral genes, resulting in a genome size intermediate between that of free-living and symbiotic Bacteroidetes species. Many of the genes retained in the Geopemphigus symbiont genome are involved in biosynthetic pathways for amino acids and vitamins, as in Buchnera and other insect symbionts. We use FISH microscopy to localize the Bacteroidetes symbiont of Geopemphigus and show symbionts housed within maternal bacteriocytes and within developing embryos. We propose the name “Candidatus Skilesia alterna” for the novel symbiont, which is evolutionarily distinct from any known bacterial species. This case of evolutionary replacement of Buchnera provides an opportunity to further understand the evolution and functional genomics of symbiosis.",

    "description": "The microbial community responsible for the biogas-producing anaerobic digestion (AD) process used to recover energy from waste is poorly characterised and likely contains many organisms not required for gas generation. Metagenomics approaches offer insights into AD communities that could potentially be exploited to improve the conversion of biomass to biogas, but distinguishing between the biological and technical variability of samples from different sources makes generalisation of results challenging. To determine how different DNA extraction methodologies and sequencing approaches influence the perceived microbiome, we analysed technical replicates of 16S rRNA amplicons and whole shotgun metagenomes from different AD systems. Here we show that diversity measurements of the microbiome in AD samples were strongly influenced by extraction regimes and analysis methodology. 16S rRNA amplification resulted in over- and under-estimation of several taxonomic phyla compared to a PCR-free metagenomics approach. Samples extracted using mechanical methods displayed significantly lower diversity and fewer observed phylotypes than samples extracted by chemical and thermal lysis, which produced higher molecular weight DNA and showed the greatest diversity in community profiles. Our results highlight that the most commonly used extraction and analysis protocols provide a skewed view of the diversity and species richness of the AD microbiome which is likely to extent to other samples. We suggest that methodological differences could be a significant source of variability among AD, and other, metagenomics studies.",

However, little is known about the transgenerational impact of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota. Here we demonstrated that adult pregnant female mice inoculated with a gut microbial community shaped by antibiotic exposure passed on their dysbiotic microbiota to their offspring. This dysbiotic microbiota remained distinct from controls for at least 5 months in the offspring without any continued exposure to antibiotics. By using IL-10 deficient mice, which are genetically susceptible to colitis, we showed mice that received an antibiotic-perturbed gut microbiota from their mothers had increased risk of colitis. Taken together, our findings indicate that the consequences of antibiotic exposure affecting the gut microbiota can extend to a second generation.",

    "description": "Heterotrophic biofilm growths were monitored in sites upstream and downstream of Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during and surrounding the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 deicing seasons. Biofilms were assessed through both field surveys and genetic investigations, and responses to environmental factors were characterized. A new strain of Sphaerotilus montanus (strain KMKE) was isolated and demonstrated growth on deicer compounds.

It shows multiple phenotypic differences with N2, including production of a copulatory plug, aggregation (social) behavior, a lack of temperature-size dependence, growth rate, fecundity and RNAi insensitivity by feeding and drug resistance (DE BONO AND BARGMANN 1998; KAMMENGA et al. 2007; GHOSH et al. 2012; POLLARD AND ROCKMAN 2013; ANDERSEN et al. 2014) as well as gene expression differences (CAPRA et al. 2008; VINUELA et al. 2012; VOLKERS et al. 2013).

However, exponential human population growth over the last 50 years has created severe additional challenges, including deteriorating fresh and marine water environments, which are the primary recipients of wastewater discharges. Increasingly complex contemporary requirements for environmental regulation, energy efficiency, enhanced nutrient and water recovery, public health risk management, and urban sustainability necessitate better understanding and control of the key biological processes that drive current and future clean water technologies. While insights into the microbiological make-up of the functional community of these critical bioprocesses have started to emerge, a greatly enhanced understanding of the mechanisms by which floccular biofilm communities perform specific transformations, including the degradation of complex organic materials and sequestration of nutrients is still required.",

    "description": "An altered interplay between gut mucosa and gut microbiota during treated HIV infection possibly contributes to increased bacterial translocation and chronic immune activation, which are predictors of morbidity and mortality. In a cohort of HIV-infected individuals on succesful antiretroviral therapy (ART) without comorbidities and in healthy controls we determined a number of systemic markers of innate and adaptive immunity. DNA was extracted from stool samples and amplicons of 16S rRNA and whole genome shot-gun sequences were analyzed, and the genus and pathways that characterized the microbiota of HIV-infected individuals were determined. HIV-infected subjects harbored a dysbiotic fecal microbiota, characterized by high levels of disease-associated bacteria, an increment of Gram-negative species and particularly by an abundance of Prevotella and Succinibivrio genera and a depletion of Bacteriodes and Faecalibaterium. This dysbiosis was related to an altered functional profile, including LPS biosynthesis –a source for systemic inflammation–, glutathione metabolism, –a bacterial mechanism to neutralize local oxidative stress–, and several inflammatory pathways. Using Bayesian network modeling, we determined that the dysbiotic bacterial community and the correlated altered metabolic pathways was associated with markers of immune dysfuntion, including impaired thymic output, heightened bactericidal-permeability increasing protein –a marker of bacterial translocation and a severe predictor of severe coronary atherosclerosis-, soluble CD14 –a marker of monocyte activation- and T-cell activation. Hence, the HIV-mediated breakdown of the gut mucosa is associated to a shift in the composition and function of gut microbiota that is not reverted by ART, even in subjects without comorbidities and optimal immunovirological response. This dysbiotic microbiota likely contributes to chronic innate and adaptive immune activation. Hence, strategies aimed at shaping the gut microbiota deserve further attention in the setting of treated HIV infection.",

    "description": "Background: The human intestinal microbiota is a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of various diseases, such as metabolic syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Yet, knowledge about the role of environmental factors such as smoking (which is known to influence theses aforementioned disease states) on the complex microbial composition is sparse. We aimed to investigate the role of smoking cessation on intestinal microbial composition in 10 healthy smoking subjects undergoing controlled smoking cessation. Methods: During the observational period of 9 weeks repetitive stool samples were collected. Based on abundance of 16S rRNA genes bacterial composition was analysed and compared to 10 control subjects (5 continuing smokers and 5 non-smokers) by means of Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis and high-throughput sequencing. Results: Profound shifts in the microbial composition after smoking cessation were observed with an increase of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria on the phylum level. In addition, after smoking cessation there was an increase in microbial diversity Conclusions: These results indicate that smoking is an environmental factor modulating the composition of human gut microbiota. The observed changes after smoking cessation revealed to be similar to the previously reported differences in obese compared to lean humans and mice respectively, suggesting a potential pathogenetic link between weight gain and smoking cessation. In addition they give rise to a potential association of smoking status and the course of IBD.",

Here we report the assembly of a haplotype-resolved diploid genome without using a reference genome. Our pipeline relies on fosmid pooling together with whole-genome shotgun strategies, based solely on next generation sequencing (NGS) and hierarchical assembly methods. We applied our sequencing method to the genome of an Asian individual and generated a 5.15 Gb assembled genome with a haplotype N50 of 484 kb. Our analysis identified previously undetected indels and novel coding sequences and revealed their impact on genes function. This haplotype-resolved genome represents the most complete de novo genome assembly to date. Application of our approach to identify individual haplotype differences should aid in translating genotypes to phenotypes for the development of personalized medicine.",

    "description": "Background: The dermal papilla (DP) comprises specialized mesenchymal cells at the bottom of the hair follicle and plays a pivotal role in hair formation, anagen induction and the hair cycle. In this study, DPs were isolated from human hair follicles and serially subcultured. From each subculture at passage 1, 3, and 5 (n = 4), we compared gene expression profiles using mRNA sequencing. Among the growth factors that were down-regulated in later passages of human DP cells (hDPCs), placental growth factor (PlGF) was selected. Objective: To elucidate the effect of PlGF on hair growth. Methods: We evaluated the effect of PlGF on hDPCs and on ex vivo hair organ culture. We investigated the effect of PlGF on an in vivo model of depilation-induced hair regeneration. Results: We confirmed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of PlGF significantly decreased following subculture of the cells. It was shown that PlGF enhanced hair shaft elongation in ex vivo hair organ culture. Furthermore, PlGF significantly accelerated hair follicle growth and markedly prolonged anagen hair growth in an in vivo model of depilation-induced hair regeneration. PlGF prevented cell death by increasing the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cyclin D1 and promoted survival by up-regulation of phosphorylated Akt and Bcl2, as determined by Western blotting.  Conclusion: Our results suggest that PlGF plays a role in the promotion of hair growth and therefore may serve as an additional therapeutic target for the treatment of alopecia",

    "description": "This study was carried out to indentify microbial populations in the industrial treatment of tannery wastewater using a microbial consortium and their specific roles during the treatment process. A novel microbial consortium enriched from the natural soils was successfully implemented to treat the tannery wastewater from leather manufacturing industries in Korea and China. The treatment process was composed of the six processes including buffering tank (B), primary aeration tank (PA), secondary aeration tank (SA), and sludge digestion tank (SD). The consortium was periodically added to B, PA, SA and SD. The water quality was monitored for COD, T-N, T-P and Chromium (Cr), etc. Microbial communities and some functions were monitored by pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time PCR techniques. The COD, T-N, T-P and Cr removal efficiencies reached 98%, 98%, 93% and 88%, respectively. Pyrosequencing data from different stages of the treatment processes revealed that the dominant phyla were similar in four different samples, while the proportions of them were shifted. The genus of Brachymonas within Proteobacteria was highly dominant in B (37.7%), SD (22.1%) and PA (17.3%), and this genus was known to associate with denitrifying process. This could be indicating an efficient removal of nitrogen and less production of sludge in the treatment system. The nitrous oxide reductase gene copies detected in B were also higher than those of PA, SA and SD in monitoring of real-time PCR. Augmentation of the mixed culture (BM-S-1) appeared to facilitate degradation of the tannery organic wastes and remove their malodor via the comprehensive metabolic activities of various microbes with little generation of sludge.",

    "description": "Anaerobic conversion of organic wastes and biomass to methane is an important bioenergy strategy, whic h depends on poorly understood mechanisms of interspecies electron transfer to methanogenic microorganisms. Metatranscriptomic analysis of methanogenic aggregates from a brewery wastewater digester, coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization with specific 16S rRNA probes, revealed that Methanosaeta species were the most abundant and metabolically active methanogens. Methanogens known to reduce carbon dioxide with H2 or formate as the electron donor were rare. Although Methanosaeta have previously been thought to be restricted to acetate as a substrate for methane production, Methanosaeta in the aggregates had a complete complement of genes for the enzymes necessary for the reduction of carbon to methane, and transcript abundance for these genes was high. Furthermore, Geobacter species, the most abundant bacteria in the aggregates, highly expressed genes for ethanol metabolism and for extracellular electron transfer via electrically conductive pili, suggesting that Geobacter and Methanosaeta species were exchanging electrons via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). This possibility was further investigated in defined co-cultures of Geobacter metallireducens and Methanosaeta harundinacea which stochiometrically converted ethanol to methane. Transcriptomic, radiotracer, and genetic analysis demonstrated that M. harundinacea was accepting electrons via DIET for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane. The discovery that Methanosaeata species, which are abundant in a wide diversity of methanogenic environments, are capable of DIET has important implications not only for the functioning of anaerobic digesters, but also for global methane production.",

    "description": "The establishment of industrial-scale, clean water technologies in the mid-late 19th century caused a notable reduction (~15%) in disease-related mortality. However, exponential human population growth over the last 50 years has created severe additional challenges, including deteriorating fresh and marine water environments, which are the primary recipients of wastewater discharges. Increasingly complex contemporary requirements for environmental regulation, energy efficiency, enhanced nutrient and water recovery, public health risk management, and urban sustainability necessitate better understanding and control of the key biological processes that drive current and future clean water technologies. While insights into the microbiological make-up of the functional community of these critical bioprocesses have started to emerge, a greatly enhanced understanding of the mechanisms by which floccular biofilm communities perform specific transformations, including the degradation of complex organic materials and sequestration of nutrients is still required.",

A WGS study of airborne microbes requires millions of liters of air be sampled to obtain enough material for sequencing; this requires long sampling times, an efficient means for capture of microbial constituents, and processes to limit post-capture growth which would skew the representation of sampled microbes. We applied this framework to study the composition of indoor and outdoor air samples collected from locations in New York City (NYC), New York and in San Diego (SD), California. Since DNA yields were inadequate for sequencing, the DNA isolated from the samples was amplified to generate sufficient amounts for library construction. Sequence data generated from the libraries were used to study the taxonomic composition of the sampled microbial communities and the functional composition of their bacterial constituents.",

    "description": "One of the cornerstones of an effective biodefense strategy is the ability to detect infectious agents with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in the context of a complex sample background.  The nature of the B. anthracis genome, however, renders specific detection difficult, due to close homology with B. cereus and B. thuringiensis.  We therefore elected to determine the efficacy of next-generation sequencing analysis and microarrays for detection of B. anthracis in an environmental background.  We applied next-generation sequencing to titrated genome copy numbers of B. anthracis in the presence of background nucleic acid extracted from aerosol and soil samples.  We found next-generation sequencing to be capable of detecting as few as 10 genomic equivalents of B. anthracis DNA per nanogram of background nucleic acid.  Detection was accomplished by mapping reads to either a defined subset of reference genomes or to the full GenBank database.  Moreover, sequence data obtained from B. anthracis could be reliably distinguished from sequence data mapping to either B. cereus or B. thuringiensis.  We also demonstrated the efficacy of a microbial census microarray in detecting B. anthracis in the same samples, representing a cost-effective and high-throughput approach, complementary to next-generation sequencing. Overall design: This Series contains the NimbleGen array data only (no next-generation sequencing data). The next-gen sequencing data from this study are accessible in the BioProject database under accession PRJNA206989. B. anthracis DNA was spiked at 6 different concentrations (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000 genome copies) into 1 ng of background nucleic acids extracted either from a soil sample or from an aerosol (air filter) sample. Two replicates of each combination of B. anthracis copy number and background sample were analyzed.",

However, the mechanisms underlying bacterial exchange among humans are poorly understood. Here, we collected 511 stool samples from children and mothers across urban and rural communities in Kenya and applied a machine learning-based strain-tracking framework to investigate bacterial strain-sharing dynamics and evaluate the impact of community-level water chlorination. This study provides new insights into how bacterial strains disseminate within and between households and communities in low- and middle-income settings. By integrating metagenomic sequencing with machine learning, it elucidates both the microbial dissemination dynamics and the extent to which community-scale water treatment can disrupt microbial spread, informing strategies to mitigate pathogen transmission in vulnerable populations.",

Although activated sludge processes are not designed to lower the abundance of pathogens or antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), their effects on the pathobiome and antimicrobial resistome require in-depth investigation. We collected wastewater samples before and after activated sludge process from five municipal wastewater treatment plants and extracted both intracellular and extracellular DNA. Shotgun sequencing was performed to characterize the bacterial community, pathobiome, and antimicrobial resistome. Our results showed that activated sludge processes significantly reduced the abundance of both potentially pathogenic bacteria and high-risk ARGs. However, viral particles carrying ARGs resulted enriched, highlighting a potential risk for ARG spreading during these processes.",
